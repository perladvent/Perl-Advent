Thank you for your interest in this year's Perl Advent Calendar.

🐪 Which Perl module do you want to write about:

Please give a short description of the article you want to write. Two to three
sentences is fine.

♥️ The calendar is a labour of love and it requires a lot of care and feeding. It
cannot survive without content submissions, but it also cannot survive without
article reviews. In order to keep the calendar's momentum sustainable, this
year I'm asking authors if they would also be willing to review someone else's
article. Reviewing/editing is not a complicated process, but it requires
patience and kindness, as many of our authors are new to the calendar, new to
Perl or even new to blogging. I have published [some editing
guidelines](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/blob/main/EDITING.md) to
follow. If this seems like something you could help with, I would be extremely
grateful for it. You are not required to review an article, so if you're not
inclined to be a reviewer, please don't let this dissuade you from submitting
a proposal.

🙏 Are you willing to act a code reviewer for another article author?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] I could possibly be convinced
