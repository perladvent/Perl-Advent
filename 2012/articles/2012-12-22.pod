=head1 Have REST-ful Holidays

Your boss comes to you the day after Thanksgiving vacation (or if you're in
Scotland, the day after St. Andrew's Bank Holiday. If you're not in Scotland or
the US, adjust accordingly).

    Boss: We need a Web API for the Flibber data. I want it to be REST-ful.

    You:  REST-ful API? Where did you hear about REST? 

    Boss: I've started reading /r/programming. Everyone is making REST APIs
          now. We need one.

    You: *sigh* I'll get right on that. 


So you need to build a REST-ful Web API in time for the Holidays. You may not
even know what REST is, beyond some buzzword your boss picked up in an internet
back-alley.

=head1 How to Explain REST to Anyone ... even Ryan Tomayko's wife.

On Ryan Tomayko blog he has 
L<a dialog with his wife|http://tomayko.com/writings/rest-to-my-wife> where he
explains REST and why it's important. We really don't have time to go into all
of the details so you should read it, but I'll try to cover the most important
bits. 

    Ryan: [...] The web is built on an architectural style called REST. REST
          provides a definition of a resource, which is what those things point 
          to.

    Wife: A web page is a resource?

    Ryan: Kind of. A web page is a representation of a resource. Resources are 
          just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser...

    Wife: I know what a URL is..

    Ryan: Oh, right. Those tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A
          browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.
          Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the
          concept.

Basically the way the world wide web works is that clients request
Representations of Resources identified by URLs (or URIs if you're pedantic).
Clients and Servers use HTTP to give and return these requests. Most requests
are by Browsers and they just want an HTML representation, but more and more
clients are requesting non-HTML representations too.  Thankfully the Web was
designed to handle this, if we just write things in the right style.

REST is the style of writing applications so that they take full advantage of
HTTP and the design of the Web. Now you know what REST is. Knowing is half the
battle.

=head1 HTTP is Hard

This is a diagram of the state machine based on the HTTP protocol. It has 57
states asking 50 different questions about how to process any given HTTP
request and generate the right response. That's a lot to keep in your head. 

Luckly there are frameworks on CPAN to help out with these. A good one for
demonstrating these is L<Web::Machine|https://metacpan.org/release/Web-Machine>
by Stevan Little. It is based on the Erlang Webmachine project by Basho (makers
of Riak!) that generated the state machine diagram.

C<Web::Machine> is broken into two parts. A Finite State machine that
implements the diagram, and a Resource base class that provides sensible
defaults that you can override in your own class. Let's just dive in.

A note, while C<Web::Machine> itself works on Perl 5.10.1 or higher, all
examples will explicitly be using 5.16.2. Remember if you change the version
line to enable strict.

=head1 It's a Time Machine!

So let's start with a basic web service. My Car doesn't have a clock in it, so
to be properly Web 2.0 compliant, I'll write a JSON service that I can later
target with an iOS client that will run from my phone. That won't be overkill
at all.

    #!perl
    use 5.16.2; 
    use Web::Machine;

    {
        package WasteOfTime::Resource;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use parent 'Web::Machine::Resource';

        use JSON::XS qw(encode_json);

        sub content_types_provided { [{ 'application/json' => 'to_json' }] }

        sub to_json { encode_json({ time => scalar localtime }) }
    }

    Web::Machine->new( resource => 'WasteOfTime::Resource' )->to_app;


C<Web::Machine> is a toolkit for building Resources. So after the standard
boiler plate we start out by defining a resource class. Although
C<Web::Machine> was written by the same guy who brough you C<Moose> it actually
tries to be minimal about it's dependencies and doesn't sneak C<Moose> in under
the covers.

So we create a class C<WasteOfTime::Resource> that will be our Resource class,
and we have it inherit from C<Web::Machine::Resource> so that C<Web::Machine>
will know it's a Resource and so that the proper defaults are set. We could be
done here, and our application would do nothing but throw a 406 NOT ACCEPTABLE.
But that's less than useful.

We know we want to provide a JSON API so we override the parent
C<content_types_provided> and say we will provide a representation of
'application/json' and that we should use the C<to_json> method to get it.

Then we define the to_json representation. This resource doesn't have any state
so we can just build the JSON inline. We use the scalar value of C<localtime>
because we want the nice string format not a list of numbers.

Finally once our resource class is built, we create a C<Web::Machine> instance,
tell it which resource class to use and then have it provide us a Plack
application. If we save all of this in a file (I chose C<time.psgi>) we can run
it.

    $ plackup time.psgi
    HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/

Which we can now access using a web client. 

    $ curl -v http://0:5000

    * About to connect() to 0 port 5000 (#0)
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
    * Connected to 0 (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5
    > Host: 0:5000
    > Accept: */*
    >
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    < HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    < Date: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 02:04:02 GMT
    < Server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
    < Content-Length: 35
    < Content-Type: application/json
    <
    * Closing connection #0
    {"time":"Sat Dec  8 21:04:02 2012"}

And you can see our Representation there at the end. If we try a request that
isn't allowed, say for an HTML representation, we will get the appropriate
error too.

    $ curl -v http://0:5000 -H'Accept: text/html'

    * About to connect() to 0 port 5000 (#0)
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
    * Connected to 0 (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5
    > Host: 0:5000
    > Accept: text/html
    >
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    < HTTP/1.0 406 Not Acceptable
    < Date: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 02:07:47 GMT
    < Server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
    < Content-Length: 14
    <
    * Closing connection #0
    Not Acceptable

We get that 406 not acceptable again.

=head1 Many Ways to Say the Same Thing

So far we're not doing bad for 20 lines of code, but what if we want that HTML
representation too? Actually it's pretty simple. First we add a new content
type.

    sub content_types_provided { [
        { 'application/json' => 'to_json' },
        { 'text/html'        => 'to_html' },
    ] }

We say that 'text/html' will be handled by C<to_html>. Now we just define a
C<to_html> method to return our HTML representation.

    sub to_html {
        join "" =>
        '<html>',
            '<head>',
                '<title>The Time Now Is:</title>',
            '</head>',
            '<body>',
                '<h1>'.localtime.'</h1>',
            '</body>',
        '</html>'
    }

Notice that C<Web::Machine> doesn't have any opinion on how you generate HTML.
You're free to use whatever template system you want. You're also free to write
all of the glue code for that. C<Web::Machine> is pretty bare bones about that,
this is why it's called a toolkit and not a framework.

So if we add this code and we issue that last request we can see the change.

    $ curl -v http://0:5000 -H'Accept: text/html'

    * About to connect() to 0 port 5000 (#0)
    *   Trying 0.0.0.0... connected
    * Connected to 0 (0.0.0.0) port 5000 (#0)
    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5
    > Host: 0:5000
    > Accept: text/html
    >
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    < HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    < Date: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 02:26:39 GMT
    < Server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
    < Vary: Accept
    < Content-Length: 103
    < Content-Type: text/html
    <
    * Closing connection #0
    <html><head><title>The Time Now Is:</title></head><body><h1>Sat Dec  8 21:26:39 2012</h1></body></html>


=head1 The Times They Are A Changing

So we're returning multiple representations, and that's great but what if we want to alter the resource? Let's let ourselves change the timezone. We'll need to C<use POSX qw(tzset)> and add some methods.

    use POSIX qw(tzset);

    sub allowed_methods { [qw[ GET POST ]] }

    sub process_post {
        my $self = shift;
        my $input = eval { JSON::XS->new->decode( $self->request->content ); }; 
        $ENV{TZ} = $input->{timezone};
        tzset;
        return 1;
    }

Changing the C<allowed_methods> lets C<Web::Machine> know we are expecting POST
requests as well as GET requests to this resource. Then when we process the
post we simply set the appropriate value.

    $ curl -v -X POST http://0:5000 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles"}'

    * About to connect() to 0 port 5000 (#0)
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
    * Connected to 0 (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
    > POST / HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5
    > Host: 0:5000
    > Accept: */*
    > Content-Type: application/json
    > Content-Length: 34
    >
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    < HTTP/1.0 204 No Content
    < Date: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 02:49:22 GMT
    < Server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
    < Vary: Accept
    < Content-Type: application/json
    <
    * Closing connection #0

If we check now, we'll see that the time has changed. 

    $ curl -v http://0:5000

    * About to connect() to 0 port 5000 (#0)
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
    * Connected to 0 (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)
    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5
    > Host: 0:5000
    > Accept: */*
    >
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    < HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    < Date: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 02:46:56 GMT
    < Server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
    < Vary: Accept
    < Content-Length: 35
    < Content-Type: application/json
    <
    * Closing connection #0
    {"time":"Sun Dec  9 02:46:56 2012"}

Since the previous times were C<America/New_York> the new times are the correct
3 hours behind.

=head1 [Somethign Witty HERE]

In addition to supporting the standard HTTP methods, C<Web::Machine> helps with
much of the rest of the HTTP standard including things like Cache Control
headers. To enable most basic cache controls simply provide a couple methods to
generate ETag and last modified headers.

    use Digest::SHA qw(sha1_hex);
    use Web::Machine::Util qw(create_date);

    sub generate_etag { sha1_hex(scalar localtime) }

    sub last_modified { create_date(scalar localtime) }

We import two new modules here. C<Digest::SHA> helps us just make a unique
identifier for our resource. C<Web::Machine::Util> helps us create the
appropriate date object that C<Web::Machine> is expecting. 

If we run our client against this now we'll see the new cache control headers. 

    $ curl -v http://0:5000

    * About to connect() to 0 port 5000 (#0)
    *   Trying 0.0.0.0... connected
    * Connected to 0 (0.0.0.0) port 5000 (#0)
    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5
    > Host: 0:5000
    > Accept: */*
    >
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    < HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    < Date: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 14:50:21 GMT
    < Server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
    < ETag: "fa4c7582066e3b42fffd346cfba9714ea66cd645"
    < Vary: Accept
    < Content-Length: 35
    < Content-Type: application/json
    < Last-Modified: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 14:50:21 GMT
    <
    * Closing connection #0
    {"time":"Sun Dec  9 09:50:21 2012"}

And if we make a request for a resource that should be cached, we get the right response code.

    $ curl -v http://0:5000 -H'If-Modified-Since: Sun, 09, Dec 2012 14:55:21 GMT'

    * About to connect() to 0 port 5000 (#0)
    *   Trying 0.0.0.0... connected
    * Connected to 0 (0.0.0.0) port 5000 (#0)
    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5
    > Host: 0:5000
    > Accept: */*
    > If-Modified-Since: Sun, 09, Dec 2012 14:55:21 GMT
    >
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    < HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified
    < Date: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 14:55:11 GMT
    < Server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
    < ETag: "f6da728260ea1563bd14ce999f0246a4817f6fee"
    < Vary: Accept
    < Last-Modified: Sun, 09 Dec 2012 14:55:11 GMT
    <
    * Closing connection #0

In addition to cache controls, C<Web::Machine> provides methods for authentication, request validation, URI validation, charset and encoding variation, and most of the rest of the HTTP spec.

=head1 The Downsides

C<Web::Machine> is pretty bare bones. It leaves a lot of opinions beyond HTTP
up to the author. This is considered a bonus because these opinions are very
much influenced heavily by the environment your application will be deployed
in. If you want a framework that provides more pre-built wheels you
may want to look at L<Magpie|http://github.com/Tamarou/magpie> which is a
framework based upon the same principles as C<Web::Machine> but takes a very
different approach for it's implementation. 

One of the principles of REST is that hypertext is the engine of application
state. Because C<Web::Machine> has no opinions on templating, or really
representation generation at all, it has no tools for building Hypermedia
Documents. I highly recomend looking at the 
L<Hypermedia Application Language|stateless.co/hal_specification.html> (HAL) 
specification for
structuring hypermedia documents. It describes serializations in both JSON and
XML depending on how old school you want to go.

Currently C<Web::Machine> also doesn't handle an asynchronous environment. To
be honest HTTP really doesn't have an asynchronous mode. The closest HTTP has
is multi-part responses which are uni-directional streams. An example of this
is the Twitter streaming API. There has been talk about adding support for this
to C<Web::Machine> but if you're looking for this, or something like Websockets
right now, C<Web::Machine> isn't the right choice.
