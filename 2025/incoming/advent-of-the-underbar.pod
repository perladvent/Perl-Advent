According to podcast index, there are (at the time of writing) 4,558,912
podcasts, 432,264 of which have been published in the last 60 days.

L<The Underbar|https://underbar.cpan.io> is one of them.

That is a lot of podcasts, and the first question that comes to mind is
"why create another one?" (quickly followed by "how long do you think
it's going to last?").

=head3 A tangent: my pandemic projects

Before I can describe the podcast, I have to go on a tangent,
which will set the stage for how I ended up creating yet another
computing podcast.

During the 2020 pandemic (I sadly think we'll have to date them),
and more specifically during the global lockdown, a lot of people were
telling the world how they spent their newly discovered free time baking
bread or exploring their artistic side.

Having worked mostly remotely for over a decade at the time (my team
was in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and I worked from the local office in
Lyon, France), I didn't feel much change (except that my office was
now in my home).

I too wanted to have lockdown projects, so I came up with three. My
hope was to complete at least one of them in a reasonable amount of time
(before the end of 2021, I think).

=head4 🗹 Le bâton de joie

My first idea was to pick up and finally finish a 20 years old project:
building an arcade joystick to play arcade games on an emulator
(such as L<MAME|https://mamedev.org>).

That project was started with two friends in 2000. Back
then, we had bought all buttons and sticks from an arcade
repair shop, pulled the electronics out of a PS/2
L<IBM Model M|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard> keyboard,
mapped the keys to the pins, and wired one joystick and two buttons. The
whole lot went into a box after we plugged it into a computer and we
managed to play a game of L<Frogger|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger>
with it.

Another reason for putting on hold is that one of the friends' wife
cheated with the other, forgetting the first rule of gaming: don't cheat
with friends. Over the course of 20 years, another friend gifted me a
chassis, that sat alongside the box for over a decade.

Picking up that project after 20 years, everything was easier. Now I
could buy USB zero delay joystick adapters on the Internet, and throw
away the keyboard electronics. I just had to drill 17 or so holes in
the chassis, screw in all the buttons and joysticks, and wire the lot
to the USB cards. After attaching a Raspberry Pi to the side (another
thing that didn't exist in 2000), I could temporarily move the Nintendo
Switch away, and show my kids what videogames looked like in the eighties.

This took a few months to complete in real time. We played our first
games in May 2021.

=head4 🗷 Programming Sentimental Advice Column

My second project I dubbed the "Perl Love Letters". The idea was to
set up a web site to collect and publish "love letters" (and possibly
breakup letters too), written to Perl by its users or ex-users as if it
were an old flame.

I've been part of the Perl community since 1999, and I've had numerous
conversations with lots of people about Perl, what we love about it, its
quirks and its future. I really believe there is a trove of interesting
stories of people discovering Perl, some sticking with it, some moving on,
etc. We collectively have a lot to say about this programming language,
and how it changed our lives.

This idea was inspired in particular with a late night
bar conversation with my then work and later L<Perl Steering
Council|https://perldoc.perl.org/perlgov##The-Steering-Council> team mate
L<Graham Knop|https://metacpan.org/author/HAARG>, who told me sincerely,
almost within the same breath, that Perl was the worst programming
language, and also his favorite one.

Alas, although I thought about it many times, I never managed to
write my own love letter to Perl. This project remains a cute idea
to this day.

(As the quote goes, "ideas are easy": if you're interested in making this
happen, please do. I promise I'll write my love letter to Perl and send
it to you once you have set up the web site.)

=head4 ☐ The book that did not exist

As I considered the shelves in my office, filled with computer books,
from those I have barely skimmed to those I read from cover to cover, I
realized that there was one book that I wanted to read. The main problem
was that no-one had written it.

I wanted to read a Larry Wall biography.

Instead of badly rephrasing it, I'll quote the email I sent Gloria Wall
in 2023 (!), to present the project:

=for :html
<blockquote>

In late 2020, at the height of the pandemic, I looked at my computer
books collection, and realized there was one book that was missing in
there. One book that I would really really love to read. A book that
would not be afraid of technical jargon, or showing some source code
or raw emails: a book written for people like me. A book that details
the enormous influence Larry Wall has had on Open Source and
programming in general.

It turned out no one had written that book yet.

For the past two years, my fantasy project has been to collect material
for whomever would write that book. I'm not an author, I'm not even a
native English speaker, so I knew from the beginning the author
couldn't be me. A year ago, I was chatting with my good friend Wendy
van Dijk, and I exposed the project to her in more detail than I had
ever written before:

=for :html
<blockquote>

I want to know about C<patch>, about C<rn>. About how C<pack> and
C<unpack> came to be. Sure, some of the personal details too, but his
philosophy of computing and collaboration is more interesting.

Also, biography is a specific kind of book. We'd need someone who
knows how to write one, and an editor, etc.

There's also the story of the early days of Open Source. Wasn't he in
the meeting where the name "open source" was coined?

He's been both influencial and humble.

I also feel I can't be the one doing it. Maybe ask some questions, run
some interviews, but one has to be a native speaker, and a writer, and
I'm neither.

=for :html
</blockquote>

[...]

At the last Perl Toolchain Summit, which I organised in my home city of
Lyon, France, I talked about this with Ingy döt Net and Leon
Timmermans. They both thought this was a great idea, and someone should
definitely do it.

[...]

I don't know if this project will actually lead anywhere. Best case, an
actual book will exist in a few years. Worst case, some material will be
available for someone better equipped than me to pick this project up.

=for :html
</blockquote>

The story of Larry Wall is intertwined with the story of Perl and the
early Internet (between the
L<Unix wars|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_wars> and the
L<Dot-com bubble|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble> burst).

The way I saw this biographical project involved a data collection step:
find and save as much of what was already available (interviews, videos,
etc). Another side of it was producing more data: get Larry's answers to
the specific questions I had, and get the people around him to talk.

The project is currently in a limbo state: I have collected some material,
but Larry is mostly retired, and doesn't seem very interested in talking
about all this. I eventually lost steam, and moved to other things.

=head3 Why create another podcast?

Back to the podcast and why I created it.

I slowly made my way into recording a podcast by listening to a few
of them.

In 2021, my colleague [Bailey Stewart](https://hachyderm.io/@bailey_writes) suggested to me the
L<On the Metal|https://onthemetal.transistor.fm/> podcast. After
listening to all episodes (and waiting for the next one for a very long
time, not realizing they had moved on to another format), I started
listening to L<Digital Citizen|https://www.fastmail.com/digitalcitizen/>,
by our very own L<Ricardo Signes|https://metacpan.org/author/RJBS>.

It was Ricardo who suggested to me in January 2024:

=for :html
<blockquote>

Advent of Computing is excellent, and I think you'd really like it.

=for :html
</blockquote>

He was right on both counts:
L<Advent of Computing|https://adventofcomputing.com/> is excellent,
and I really like it.

The history of computing and programming is one of my favorite topics
(my shelves contain both books about the history of computing, and
historical computing books).

The unwritten book project, combined with my recent interest in computing
podcasts, planted the idea of making my own podcast in my head. Telling
the story of Larry Wall's enormous influence on modern computing is an
herculean tasks, probably beyond my reach, but that wouldn't prevent me
from trying to record some fireside stories of the Perl community.

A little bit over a year ago, as I was trying to write my
L<Advent Calendar entry|https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-22.html>
for 2024, I started talking with L<Olaf Alders|https://metacpan.org/author/OALDERS>
about the idea that had taken root in my head:

=for :html
<blockquote>

I'm listening to podcasts, and there's one I'm slowly getting into
L<https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends> It feels like being
in a bar conversation with other technical people. I don't always fully
understand what they're talking about, but I like what I hear.

I'm been thinking about having something like this with people I
know for some time, thinking about doing it at work (but being worried
that the suits would not like the idea of a recording, and that maybe
the participants wouldn't like it too much either). I already do "old
men ranting calls" with colleagues, but we haven't recorded them so
far. Would probably be too controversial anyway...

Now I'm wondering if an idea like that could work with Perl
people. We're used to hanging out in bars, after all! What do you think?

=for :html
</blockquote>

To which Olaf replied:

=for :html
<blockquote>

I think it would be an interesting experiment. I have fond memories
of Perlcast: <https://perlcast.net/>

=for :html
</blockquote>

I believe Olaf's superpower is to encourage people to actually do what
they already wanted to do in the first place, and just jump in.

=head4 JFDI in action

This was also an experiment in getting things done in spite of my
perfectionist mindset. Better make something now and improve it over time,
than plan for the perfect outcome and never achieve anything. (As noted
earlier, ideas are easy. The real effort is in delivering on those ideas.)

Over the years, I've tried to think less and do more, because I also
know that (according to
L<The Cult of Done Manifesto|https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13>),
"Done is the engine of more". And I want to have produced more than just
ideas with my time in this world.

Anyway, at the end of December 2024, we picked the topic I<du jour> (the
new Perl logo), grabbed everyone who was involved, and eventually recorded
our conversation. L<Thibault Duponchelle|https://metacpan.org/CONTRA>
helped with editing this first episode (which was numbered 0, obviously),
while I slapped the new Perl logo on the podcast logo (I've been having
a lot of fun creating the logos for the individual episodes!) and
created a L<static web site|https://underbar.cpan.io> to host L<the
feed|https://underbar.cpan.io/feed.rss>. In our excitement, we went from
recording to publication in little more than`a week!

I managed to convice Olaf to be my co-host: I think we complement each other 
well, and that widens the scope of questions we ask to our guests.

=head4 Podcasting as data collection

My goal is not just to record those interesting conversations with
the people who make things happen. Using modern technology, it's very
easy to have good enouhgh transcripts. Apple Podcasts generates one
automatically after publication, and when using Zoom (thanks to
L<The Perl and Raku Foundation|https://perlfoundation.org/> for letting
us use their license to record some of our episodes), we have a transcript
along the raw recording.

My plan is not only to edit and add those as closed captions for the
podcast, but also put them on the L<web site|https://underbar.cpan.io/>,
for better searchability and indexing. Adding notes for the readers is
also a goal. This would let us explain the jargon, and point to more
sources for those who want to dig in.

I want to record witness accounts, from primary sources, of what the Perl
and Open Source communities have achieved over the years.

=head3 How long will this last?

I didn't want to fall into the classic blunder of buying new gear
for a new project, and then leaving it gathering dust on a shelf
because the project went nowhere. So I promised myself I'd only
get a proper microphone when I have published enough episodes
with a regular schedule. My self-imposed target was the end of
the year and the holiday season. By then, we'll have published
L<9 episodes|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/>, and I expect to find
a nice microphone under the tree this year. (Here is your connection to
Santa Claus for this Advent Calendar entry!)

Hopefully, as long as there are people interested in talking about past,
present and future Perl, we'll be able to get them to talk to us. I've set
my sights on a relaxed schedule (one episode a month), which doesn't put
me under too much pressure. I'm also not doing this alone: Olaf Alders
is co-hosting the podcast with me, Salve Nielsen is bringing his ideas
and contact list to the talk, and Thibault Duponchelle is regularly
reminding me of my responsibilities as a publisher. Dave Cross made
one of the first pull requests, to add a prominent link to the podcast
feed on every page of the web site. And of course, 
L<over 20 people|https://underbar.cpan.io/cast/> have been talking with
us on the podcast!

I've paced myself, because I'm in this for the long run. One episode
a month seem about right as a schedule. I want to have more of those
conversations, I want to hear the story of Perl and its communities,
and more generally, of Open Source and Unix communities and projects.

L<We haven't run out of topics yet.|https://github.com/book/the_underbar/blob/main/EPISODE-IDEAS.md>

=head4 The first year

After the first episode, we just ran from there: at the end of February
we had recorded another episode, on a more controversial topic (L<Perl
42|https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/blob/main/ppcs/ppc0025-perl-version.md>).

It took more time than expected to get it published (May), but we
respected the self-imposed schedule of one episode a month since (the
August episode was delayed until September; since there was also a
September episode, so I count this as within the margin of error).

Here's a summary of our published episodes:

=over 4

=item *

Episode 0 - L<The New Perl Logo|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/0>

Episode 1 and 2 - L<Perl leadership|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/0> and L<Perl 42|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/2>

=back

During the Perl Toolchain Summit 2025 in Leipzig,
L<Salve Nielsen|https://metacpan.org/SJN> lended his recording material,
and we spent the entire Sunday recording conversations with teams
assembled there. This led to four more episodes:

=over 4

Episode 3 - L<MetaCPAN|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/3>

Episode 5 - L<Test::Smoke|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/4>

Episode 6 - L<CPAN Testers|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/6>

=item *

Episode 7 - L<CPAN Security Group|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/7>

=back

During PTS, I also spent some time talking with Salve about the upcoming
European CRA law, and we thought it would be useful to record a version
of that conversation for a larger audience:

=over 4

=item *

Episode 4 - L<The Cyber Resilience Act|https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/4>

=back

Salve has a lot of contacts in the Open Source
community, and he managed to get a slot on L<Olaf
Kolkman|https://www.internetsociety.org/author/kolkman/>'s busy
schedule. We recorded a three hour conversation with the pionneer of DNS
SEC and prominent Internet Society member Olaf Kolkman, which will make
up our next two episodes.

=head4 Help needed

The podcast format captures the conversations, and makes it easy to
enjoy those conversations while doing something else (I do most of my
own podcast listening while walking outside or cooking). But if this
material is meant to be used as "primary source" for some future work
about the history of Perl and its community, text is going to be the
best format long term.

If there are topics you want to listen to, or corrections you want to
make to the web site, you can write to C<underbar> AT C<cpan.io> or submit
a pull request to L<the repository|https://github.com/book/the_underbar>

Can't wait to hear from you!
