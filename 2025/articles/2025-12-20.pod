Title: How SUSE is Using Perl
Topic: OpenQA, Open Build Service

=encoding utf8

Last year we started a new Perl Advent Calendar tradition, where we have a
remote presentation as part of the calendar. That presentation was L<Half My
Life With Perl|https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-19.html> by Randal
Schwartz. This year we we had the pleasure of hearing from Michael Schröder,
Tina Müller and Oliver Kurz talking about how Perl is in use at
L<SUSE|https://www.suse.com>.

The primary coverage of the talk concerns SUSE's L<openQA|https://open.qa/> and
the L<Open Build Service|https://openbuildservice.org/>. These both lean
heavily on Perl and are tools that you may find useful in your own work.
