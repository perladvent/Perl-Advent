<dl>
<dt>What's the purpose of the calendar?
<dd><p>Be sure you are familiar with the <a href="../FAQ.html">calendar's
background</a> before tackling an entry.
</p>

<dt>What kinds of things are worth writing about?
<dd><p>We wish to use the calendar to highlight underappreciated
<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and useful Perl modules. These are typically on
CPAN but may be a part of the CORE, or housed elsewhere. These modules tend to
be a bit older and more mature, but up-and-comers are also welcome, as is the
occasional utility in Perl.</p><p>You should consult the
<a href="../archives-AZ.html">calendar archives</a>
for an idea of what we're looking for, and what to avoid duplicating without
good reason. Code which is generally useful to larger numbers of people is more
intersting, but modules for specialized fields such as BioPerl can provide
readers with a window into the wide variety of arenas in which Perl is used.
</p><p>Note: We generally consider writing about your own module a conflict of
interest, besides which you're probably too close to the material. Only rarely
do we cover an <tt>Acme::</tt> module, for variety.</p>

<dt>I'd like to help but can't think of anything&hellip;
<dd>If you're serious about participating we can point you at our spool of ideas.

<dt>Naming
<dd><p>Ideally an article title would relate to both the topic at hand as well
as Christmas. This can be quite difficult so suitably geeky/punny titles only
relating to the topic are also acceptable.</p>

<dt>What's the format?
<dd><p>Please consult the <a href="../2006/">2006</a> and especially
<a href="../2005/">2005</a> calendars' entries for an idea of the writing style.
We prefer entries that are a bit "tighter" than a typical magazine column
about Perl i.e; Step-by-step annotation of the code sample's purpose/writing
process should be avoided. Think "suitable for a quick break at work." There
should generally be only a single code sample at the end of the article, which
is commented as necessary and easy to understand after the body of the
article has been read. The sample serves as a simple example of module use and
a seed for cargo-culting by readers experimenting further with the featured
module. Submissions requiring less editing are more likely to be accepted.</p>
<p>
Additional style considerations include:
<ul>
<li>the code sample should be appened to the document from the results of a
<tt>perltidy -nnn -html</tt></li>
<li>file-, module and program names should be wrapped in <tt>&lt;tt&gt;</tt></li>
<li>avoid excessive use of headings within the body</li>
<li>if you wish to discuss key bits of the sample code in the body of the text, try referring to the line numbers of the appended listing instead of replicating them in the main article.</li>
<li>the entry should try to dig deeper than the documentation, exposing unforeseen (ab)uses or nasty tidbits; you need not simply laud the virtues of The Fine Module, criticism is okay</li>
<li>humor is good</li>
</ul>

<dt>Editing
<dd><p>Be advised that submissions may be edited for style and only rarely for
content. Upon submission we will provide inital feedback for you to consider
and incorporate. We try to be open about the editing process and will do our
best to provide you with a sample before hand, though this may not always be
possible and we will not wait indefinitely for follow-up.</p>

<dt>Article licensing
<dd><p>Be aware that entries are published under the Creative Commons
Attribution License. See the <a href="../FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for further details.
If you have <em>stong</em> ethical objections to this, we may accept an
alternative license at our discretion.</p>

<dt>Publication
<dd><p>Decisions to publish are at the discretion of the editor and final.
When submitting an entry please also indicate if we may keep it on file
for future consideration.</p>
</dl>

<p>Hopefully all of the details have made things clearer, not scared you off,
and you're ready to contribute and have some fun.</p><p>Best of luck.</p>

<a name="1">1</a>. Underappreciated is not wholly exclusive of being listed on 
the <a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/100/">Phalanx 100</a>, but it's much
harder to make the case for something that's downloaded so often as being
underappreciated.
