The weeks leading up to Christmas is a stressful time for most elves
at the North Pole.  Not so for Buster Stripytights. No...I<every> week was
stressful for him.

You see, Buster's job is nothing short of making sure that enough
toys were produced throughtout the year.  Every week it's his
job to compute how production is going, if they were ahead or
behind schedule, and if Santa was going to have enough toys to
make every good child happy, or if it was going to be a disaster
this year.  It hasn't happened yet, but it's only thanks to the
dilligent work of Mr Stripytights that any issue has been
detected and dealt with before it became a real problem.

As you can imagine, this involves a lot of number crunching and
What-If type predictions.  Most importantly, it involves a lot
of quick data visualization.

A few years ago Buster had dispared about getting the kind of
interactive output he needed from his Perl data crunching
scripts, that was of course until the Wise Old Elf had shown
his this one quick trick for immediately displaying
an interactive web page from his command line script.

=head2 The Plan

The Wise Old Elf was a big fan of the Mojolicious web
framework for this kind of thing, but of course nothing
in his technique 

=for :html
  <ul>
    <li>Do some processing of data in the script</li>
    <li>Find a random unused port on localhost</li>
    <li>Open a webserver on that unused port</li>
    <li>Open the browser to point at that port</li>
    <li>When the browser window is closed, quit the script</li>
  </ul>

Simple! Let's break it down how to do that.

=head2 

The most basic of L<Mojolicious> apps (using the L<Mojolicious::Lite>
framework) looks like this.

    #!perl
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use Mojolicious::Lite;
    use experimental 'signatures';

    get '/' => 'index';

    our $message = "Merry Christmas from the script!";

    app->start('daemon');

    __DATA__
    @@ index.html.ep
    <html>
    <body>
    <%= $main::message %>
    </body>
    </html>

Running the script shows it starts up a server on the 

    $ ./script.pl
    [2019-11-23 10:20:42.21211] [19502] [info] Listening at "http://*:3000"

We defined just one route (C</>) that renders the C<index>
template in the C<DATA> section.

=head2 Picking a Random Port

At the moment our server will always open on the standard
Mojolicious development port, port 3000.  But Buster needs
to be able to display more than one graph on the screen
at any one time!  Each of these servers are going to have
to pick their own port to run on.

This is actually quite simple with the help of the
L<Net::EmptyPort> module.

    #!perl
    use Net::EmptyPort qw( empty_port );
    my $base_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:' . empty_port();
    app->start('daemon','--listen', $base_url );

=head2 Opening The Page Automatically

To make this more like an "app" we don't want Buster
to have to copy any paste the URL from the terminal
into his browser after the program starts up.  We
want the web page just to immediately open up as
sson 

This can be achieved by hooking the C<before_server_start>
Mojolicious event to call C<open_browser> from the
ever-so-handy L<Browser::Open> module as soon as
we're ready to serve web pages.

While we're at it we don't need Mojolicious to
print URLs or debug information out to the console,
so we supress all of that


    #!perl
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use Mojolicious::Lite;
    use experimental 'signatures';

    use Net::EmptyPort qw( empty_port );
    use Browser::Open qw( open_browser );

    get '/' => 'index';

    # stop logging out when we visit URLs
    app->log->level('warn');

    # open the browser as soon as we start
    my $base_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:' . empty_port();
    app->hook(before_server_start => sub ($server, @) {
        $server->silent(1);  # don't display "Server available..."
        open_browser($base_url);
    });

    app->start('daemon','--listen', $base_url );
    ...

=head2 Quitting Time

To make this like a real application we don't want Buster to have
to remember to head back to the terminal and ctrl-C the command
line program when he's done with the graph.  There must be
some way to automatically quit the script as soon as the
browser window closes!

We can hook the C<unload> event in JavaScript fairly easily:

    #!vim javascript
    window.addEventListener( "unload", ... );

But what should we do?  Ideally we'd like to send a HTTP
request back to the browser, but doing this via AJAX is
unreliable: The page might complete closing before the
asynchronous web request gets far enough along.  Never
fear!  We're running a faily modern web browser, so we
can make use of I<beacons>.

The Beacon API is a fire-and-forget non-blocking way to
tell the browser to make a HTTP POST request
I<as soon as it is able to> and we don't care about
the result.  This means we can make a simple call like
so:

    #!vim javascript
    navigator.sendBeacon("/exit")

And the browser will continue to make the call to our
backend even after its closed the window with our
webpage in it.


    #!perl
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use Mojolicious::Lite;
    use experimental 'signatures';

    ...

    get '/' => 'index';

    # when our beacon notifies us, just quit right away
    post '/exit' => sub { exit };

    ...

    __DATA__
    @@ index.html.ep
    <html>
    <script>
    // when the page is closed have the browser send a POST
    // to /exit to tell Mojolicious to shut down
    window.addEventListener(
        "unload",
        () => navigator.sendBeacon("/exit"),
        false
    );
    </script>
    <body>
    <%= $main::message %>
    </body>
    </html>

=head2 Putting It All Together

Now we can put all of this together into building a script that
dynamically shows any CSV as a graph:

    #!perl
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use Mojolicious::Lite;
    use experimental 'signatures';

    use Net::EmptyPort qw( empty_port );
    use Browser::Open qw( open_browser );
    use Text::CSV_XS ();

    ##########################################################

    my $filename = shift;

    my $csv = Text::CSV_XS->new({ binary => 1, auto_diag => 1 });
    open my $fh, "<:encoding(utf8)", $filename or die "$filename: $!";

    my $data = {};
    my $titles = $csv->getline($fh);
    my $xlabel = shift @{ $titles };
    $data->{labels} = [];
    $data->{datasets} = [
        map { +{ label => $_, data => [] } } @{ $titles }
    ];

    while (my $row = $csv->getline($fh)) {
        push @{ $data->{labels} }, shift @{ $row };
        push @{ $data->{datasets}[ $_ ]{data} }, $row->[ $_ ]
            for 0..(scalar(@{ $row })-1);
    }

    close $fh or die "$filename: $!";

    ##########################################################

    get '/' => sub ($c, @) {
        $c->render(
            'index',
            title  => $filename =~ s/[.]csv$//r,
            xlabel => $xlabel,
            cols   => $data,
        );
    };
    post '/exit' => sub { exit };

    app->log->level('warn');

    my $base_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:' . empty_port();
    app->hook(before_server_start => sub ($server, @) {
        $server->silent(1);
        open_browser($base_url);
    });

    app->start('daemon','--listen', $base_url );

                }
            );
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>

Of course, we could go further than all of this, making a completely
interactive application...but that's a project for another day...
