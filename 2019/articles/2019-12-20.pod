Title: Controlling your Terminal with Perl
Topic: iTerm and Perl
Author: Mark Fowler <mark@twoshortplanks.com>

L<iTerm|https://iterm2.com/> is a heck of a terminal emulator for
macOS.  Not only is it rock solid, fast, and efficient - it's also
exteremly powerful - and can both be controlled B<by Perl> and B<can control
Perl>.

=head2 Are We Nearly There Yet?

In addition to the standard control sequences iTerm supports L<Proprietary Escape Codes|https://iterm2.com/documentation-escape-codes.html>
that can get it to do non-standard things a real dumb terminal would never
be able to do.

For example, my standard wrapper for running tests in Perl looks like this:

   perl -e 'print "\e]50;ClearScrollback\a"' &&
   yath -v -Ilib t/01mytest.t \
   && perl -e 'print "\e]9;\nALL OK\a"' || perl -e 'print "\e]9;\nFAILED\a"'

That first sends the control sequence to clear the screen and delete all history
(so scrolling to the top takes me to the top of the test.)  It then runs the
tests, and I can go make a cup of tea, because the script will send a
notification that'll bleep as soon as tests are done running to tell me if
it's succeeded or failed.

=head2 Clickable Links

Another neat trick that iTerm supports allowing programs to markup their output
so that text becomes clickable.  For example this creates a clickable link to
google about Perl.

    #!perl
    print "Search more about ";
    my $href = 'http://google.com?q=Perl';
    my $text = 'Perl';
    print "\e]8;;$href\a$text\e]8;;\a";
    print ".\n";

Of course, the links don't have to be pages on the web - you can trigger
anything that has a URL scheme on macOS.  Here I can click on the bullet
point links to add them to OmniFocus:

    #!perl
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use 5.024;
    use warnings;
    use experimental 'signatures';

    say "* ".clickable_link('Buy Milk', 'omnifocus:///add?name=Buy%20milk');
    say "* ".clickable_link('Debug Program', 'omnifocus:///add?name=Debug%20Program');

    sub clickable_link($text, $href) {
        return "\e]8;;$href\a$text\e]8;;\a";
    }

=head2 Clickable Recognizable Text

So far we've been talking about having the programs running in the terminal
in control.  What if we want to do it the other way round - configure the
terminal to react to things in the terminal and decide what to do itself?

This kind of thing is configured in the I<Profiles> section of iTerm's
preferences.  iTerm can be configured to switch to any profile you create
automatically.  For example here I've configured it to switch to this
profile whenever I'm in the C<RuleTheWorld> project dir in my homedir.

=for :html
  <center><img src="autoswitch.png" width="542" height="507" ></center>

Now I can click on the C<Edit> button below C<Smart Selection> to define
some new selection rules.  Let's create one for Perl error messages.

=for :html
  <center><img src="perlerr.jpg" width="804" height="354" ></center>

Now if if hit C<Edit> I can start defining context menu opens for when I
right click on anything that matches the regex.  The first menu item I
create can also be activated by cmd-clicking on the match.

=for :html
  <center><img src="actions.jpg" width="564" height="282" ></center>

Now when I command-click on an error message it'll open the file in
VSCode at the right line number.

=head2 Triggers

Triggers are similar to clickable text, except you don't have to click on
them - they happen immediately as the terminal sees the text being sent to
it.  

For example, you might recognize the message Hypnotoad prints out when starting
up and open the browser window.  Or you might have a command on the remove
server print out something (like a file name) in a recognizable format and have
the local machine do something like it (such as trigger a script to download
that file and open in the editor).

One of my all time favorite hacks is to have iTerm color code the backgrounds
of my Perl error messages so they're easy to spot.

=for :html
  <center><img src="highlight.png" width="558" height="108" ></center>

I use two different colors for the highlighting - red indicates the error
message came from an absolute path (meaning it's an installed library, not
my code, and I'm less likely to change it) whereas green means it's local
code that I probably need to fix.

=for :html
  <center><img src="term.png" width="512" height="281" ></center>

Of course, combined with the previous tip, I can cmd-click on these links to
open them in vscode.

=head2 Complete Control

For the ultimate control you can have iTerm start a "coprocess".  This means
that as well as rendring what it's being sent it'll also send a copy to an
external running program (a I<co-process>.)  That process can either simply
monitor what's being printed to the terminal, or it can send it's own output
which will be interpreted as the user having typed that at the terminal.

Coprocessses can be started manually, or by a user key combination, or even
by a trigger recognizing some text that indicates a program you want to control
automatically from you

=head2 Syncing our C<lib> directory

One cool trick I use coprocesses for is transferring my C<lib> directory of
custom modules to any machine I'm connected to.  Rather than worrying about
if that machine can access the internet, if I can put the fils in my home
directory somewhere insecure or not, or if I can connect directly to the
machine I'm logged into to transfer files - I have a different solution.

I just type them in again on each machine.

Or rather, the co-process does this for me.  Here's an the example coprocess
script to transfer the lib directory.

    #!/bin/sh

    echo 'stty_orig=`stty -g`'
    echo 'stty -echo'
    echo 'clear'
    echo 'echo "Please wait, transfering"'
    echo "cd ~";
    echo "base64 -d | tar -xzf -"
    cd ~
    tar -czf - -C ~ lib | base64 -b 72
    perl -e 'print "\x{04}"'
    echo 'clear'
    echo 'echo "All done!"'
    echo 'stty $stty_orig'

If you squint hard enough you can actually work out what this is doing.
It types a command on the remote machine to base64 decode anything that the user
types and send it to tar to spit out to the filesystem.  It then runs a
command locally to tarball up the lib dir and print out the base64 encoding
- effectively typing it over the wire to the command we just set up.  It finally
sends a ctrl-d to let the other end we're done before resetting the terminal.

=head2 Conclusion

I've barely scratchd the surface of what iTerm2 can do here, but I hope I've
convinced you to give yourself th gift of an optimized environment this year!
