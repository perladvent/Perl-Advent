# Perl Advent Calendar

The [Perl Advent Calendar](https://perladvent.org) is a series of
articles that run from December 1 to 25 each year.

## Authors

Raise an issue suggesting your topic.

Fork the repo and start a new article. The script will prompt you
for a few things and will create a new file for you under *YEAR*/incoming/.

```bash
perl script/new-article.pl
```

Edit your article, and test it as you work:

```bash
perl t/article_pod.t 2023/incoming/your-article.pod
```

When you are satisfied, create a pull request. You can keep working
on the article and pushing updates to your fork; the pull request
will automatically see the updates.

## The website

### 0. Add previous year to `archives.yaml`

Currently this needs to be run manually once per year, in the new year.

```bash
./year2yaml $(perl -MTime::Piece -le 'print localtime->year - 1') 
```

### 1. Build root files

To create some root files from `archives.yaml`:

- `archives.html` - list of advent calendars
- `archives-AZ.html` - list of modules
- `archives-Yd.html` - list of articles

Execute the following script:

```bash
perl mkarchives .
```

### 2. Build all (recent) advent calendars

```bash
cpm install -g WWW::AdventCalendar App::HTTPThis
```

Then build all recent calendars

```bash
$ for year in $(seq 2011 2023); do cd $year && advcal -c advent.ini -o `pwd` && cd ..; done
```

### 3. Test (locally)

Start HTTP webserver in one line:

```bash
http_this --autoindex .
```
