Ernest the Elf sat outside Santa's office. It was August, a time of year
the boss was usually less stressed. A good thing, as he had some bad news
to deliver.

The door opened and an elf that Ernest vaguely recognized from the staff
lunch room emerged and hastened down the hall. A booming voice came from
inside the office. "Next!"

Ernest hurried in and the old man gestured for him to take a seat. This
was his first time meeting Santa in person since he'd started with the
company. "Sir, I'm afraid I have some bad news about the ninja robot
aliens."

"Please," Santa said, "no need to call me 'Sir'. Everybody just calls me
'Santa'. So what's going on with the ninja robot aliens? I know they're
going to be popular. It's summer and I'm already getting letters. You're
heading up the software development for them, right?"

Ernest nodded. "Yes, we've been writing it using Moose." He paused. The
silence was interrupted by Rudolf's honks outside in the field.

"Appropriate!" Santa laughed, his belly shaking like a bowlful of jelly.

"Indeed," said Ernest. "But legal have just told us we can't use Moose.
No third party code can be bundled unless it has a warranty."

"Legal," grumbled the old man. "You know last year they tried telling me
I can't drink alcohol at every single house I stop at while operating a
sophisticated flying sleigh? Bunch of killjoys. Are you using the metaobject
protocol?" Santa asked, displaying a knowledge of Perl programming which
surprised Ernest.

"No," said Ernest. "But switching to Moo isn't an option anyway, because
that doesn't have a warranty either. We can only use core Perl because
our embedded hardware support contract covers that."

Santa frowned. "I guess that would need a big rewrite. Is there enough
time before December?"

Ernest shook his head. "Not if we want to leave enough time for code
reviews, acceptance testing, quality assurance..." His voice trailed off.

"Let's take a look at the code," Santa suggested, pulling up a fresh
checkout of the repository and turning his screen around so Ernest could
go through it with him. He opened up a random class.

   #!perl
   use v5.24;
   use experimental 'signatures';

   package Robot::Alien::Ninja::Face;

   use Moose;
   use Time::HiRes 'sleep';

   my $eye_class = 'Robot::Alien::Ninja::Face';

   has eyes => (
      is => 'ro',
      isa => "ArrayRef[$eye_class]",
      builder => '_build_eyes',
   );

   ...;

   sub _build_eyes ( $self ) {
      return [ $eye_class->new, $eye_class->new ];
   }

   sub blink ( $self, %arg ) {
      $_->close for $self->eyes->@*;
      sleep( $arg{time} // 0.2 );
      $_->open for $self->eyes->@*;
   }

   sub wink ( $self, %arg ) {
      my $eye = $self->eyes->[ $arg{eye} // 0 ];

      $eye->close;
      sleep( $arg{time} // 0.4 );
      $eye->open;
   }

   ...;

   __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

Santa nodded while reading it. "Pretty clean code." His fingers flew
across the keyboard, tapping in a few commands.

   cd ~/src/Robot-Alien-Ninja
   cpanm Mite
   mite init Robot::Alien::Ninja
   mite compile

He then edited Face.pm replacing C<< use Moose >> with
C<< use Robot::Alien::Ninja::Mite -all >>, and replaced
C<< __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable >> with C<< true >>.

He ran C<< mite compile >> again and then started the test suite. It all
passed.

"So will legal let us distribute Mite?" Ernest asked, confused.

"That's the beauty of it!" Santa smiled. "Your code doesn't depend on
Mite. It depends on Robot::Alien::Ninja::Mite, which is under 300 lines
long and you can audit in a few hours. Mite itself is a tool that lives
on your development machine, but doesn't need to be installed on the
ninja robot pirates."

"Aliens," said Ernest.

"Of course, aliens," said Santa, making a mental note for what was sure
to be I<next> year's hit toy. "Think about it this way. You use, what,
emacs to edit your code?"

Ernest nodded.

"Well, the end user doesn't need emacs to run your code. Mite is just a
development tool."

It began to make sense to Ernest. "Does Mite support everything Moose does?"

Santa shook his head. "There are some limitations, but skimming through
your code, it should handle most of what you need. It has attributes with
type constraints and coercion, triggers, defaults, and delegation; it has
method modifiers; it has roles. In fact, it even has some features Moose
doesn't have." His fingers flew into a blur on the keyboard.

   #!perl
   use v5.24;
   use experimental 'signatures';

   package Robot::Alien::Ninja::Face;

   use Robot::Alien::Ninja::Mite -all;
   use Time::HiRes 'sleep';

   my $eye_class = 'Robot::Alien::Ninja::Face';

   has eyes => (
      is      => ro,
      isa     => "Tuple[ $eye_class, $eye_class ]",
      builder => sub {
         return [ $eye_class->new, $eye_class->new ]
      },
   );

   # XXX: add eye patch support?

   ...;

   signature_for blink => (
      named => [
         time => 'PositiveNum', { default => 0.2 },
      ],
   );

   sub blink ( $self, $arg ) {
      $_->close for $self->eyes->@*;
      sleep( $arg->time );
      $_->open for $self->eyes->@*;
   }

   signature_for wink => (
      named => [
         time => 'PositiveNum',       { default => 0.4 },
         eye  => 'PositiveOrZeroInt', { default => 0 },
      ],
   );

   sub wink ( $self, $arg ) {
      my $eye = $self->eyes->[ $arg->eye ];

      $eye->close;
      sleep( $arg->time );
      $eye->open;
   }

   ...;

   1;

Santa ran C<mite compile> and ran the test suite again.

Ernest watched as it passed. "Do you mind committing that into a branch?
I'd like to go back to my workstation and test it out some more."

Santa nodded. "On your way out, could you send in the next elf?"
