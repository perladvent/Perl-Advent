Title: St. Nick's Reindeers Need H2O!
Topic: Util::H2O

=encoding utf8

Reindeer are generally hardy creatures, but the ones Santa chooses
must also be of the I<heartiest> character. Though they spend only
24 hours of the whole year I<in flight>, it is during this marathon
that they must cheerfully give all they have. And Santa makes sure
that they have all the hydration and other essentials their bodies
need. Recently St. Nick's head reindeer trainer has purchased a new
set of I<Camelbak> personal H2O delivery systems that is highly
tuned for use I<in flight>, which have 3 reservoirs rather than
the standard 1, so that they don't get too parched.

Being one who obviously dabbles in Perl in the off season, Santa
was reminded of a module he recently added to the "Good List". It
is called L<Util::H2O> and it a relatively new addition to the
growing list of Perl modules on CPAN that turn C<HASH> references to
blessed references with automatically generated accessor methods.

Santa has, in fact, been sorely tempted to move this module to
the C<Very Good Module List> since he's found it so handy with all
of the Perl programming he does that involves C<HASH> references. He
finds it particularly useful when wrangling results from L<DBI>'s
C<selectall_hashref> method, the results produced from his web
scraping activities using L<Web::Scraper>, or the C<HASH> reference
he gets after C<decode_json>'ing a block of JSON data from the
different web API he uses to track the online activities everyone
on his various I<watch> lists based on a new I<goodness> metric
Mrs. Claus has been affectionately calling it, I<Santa's Credit Score>.

Just recently, Santa created this script that uses L<Util::H2O> to
add accessors to data I<in flight> in order to make it easier to
manage the response C<HASH> reference returned by L<HTTP::Tiny>.

=begin perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use JSON       qw//;
use HTTP::Tiny qw//;
use Util::H2O; # only exports 'h2o'

=end perl
  
Santa can slip C<h2o> inline to his C<GET> request with more ease
than he's able to slip into a chimney! Can I<you> spot the addition
of C<h2o>?

=begin perl

# give's Santa "$response->content", "$response->status", "$response->success", etc
# from HTTP::Tiny's response object (pure HASH)
  
my $http = HTTP::Tiny->new;
my $response = h2o $http->get(q{https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users});

=end perl

Checking for success is clean and easy,

=begin perl

# check for unsuccessful web request

if (not $response->success) {
    print STDERR qq{Can't get list of online persons to watch!\n};
    printf STDERR qq{Web request responded with with HTTP status: %d\n}, $response->status;
    exit 1;
}

=end perl

The JSON C<content> in the I<HTTP> call is also easily accessed so
that it may be turned into a Perl data structure via C<JSON::decode_json>.

  # decode JSON from response content
  my $json_array_ref = JSON::decode_json($response->content); # $json is an ARRAY reference

In this case and after referencing the API response specification,
Santa can see that he gets an C<ARRAY> of C<HASH> references:

  # [
  #  {
  #    "id": 1,
  #    "name": "Leanne Graham",
  #    "username": "Bret",
  #    "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
  #    "address": {
  #      "street": "Kulas Light",
  #      "suite": "Apt. 556",
  #      "city": "Gwenborough",
  #      "zipcode": "92998-3874",
  #      "geo": {
  #        "lat": "-37.3159",
  #        "lng": "81.1496"
  #      }
  #    }
  #  },
  # ...
  # ]
  
And even though C<h2o> only works on C<HASH> references, this
provides I<yet another> opportunity for Santa to use C<h2o> on each
I<item> in the C<ARRAY>, which makes dealing with each person's
record much more jolly:
  
=begin perl

print qq{lat, lng, name, username\n};

foreach my $person (@$json_array_ref) {

    # -recurse creates deep accessors, e.g.,
    #  $person->address->geo->lat;
    
    h2o -recurse, $person;

    printf qq{%5.4f, %5.4f, %s, %s\n},
             $person->address->geo->lat,   # deep chain of accessors from '-recurse'
             $person->address->geo->lng,   # deep chain of accessors from '-recurse'
             $person->name,
             $person->username;
}

=end perl

Santa thinks this is such a nice interface for Perl C<HASH>
references, he might even be able to convince the Easter bunny to
finally get off His cotton tail and finally create that centralized
database they and the Tooth Fairy can use all year long ... yanno,
for distributing good stuff I<only>.

=head1 Conclusion
  
With St. Nick's list now complete with online usage profiles for
all people, he now sets his mind on more jolly thoughts; not sugar
plums and candy canes, but all the applications for which he may
use C<Util::H2O> to make working with C<HASH> references I<in
flight> more pleasant:

=over 4

=item L<DBI>

=item L<HTTP::Tiny>

=item L<Web::Scraper>

=item L<Config::Tiny>

=item L<JSON>


=item L<Getopt::Long> (with L<Util::H2O::More>'s C<opt2h2o>)

=back

He may even check out using the C<bless> replacement, C<baptise>,
which is contained in L<Util::H2O::More> and is like C<bless>, but
gives you the ability to create accessors too!

Don't get on Santa's I<Naughty List> by using cumbersome and chunky
Perl I<OOP> frameworks when all you really need is a little H2O.
Go check out L<Util::H2O> and see if it's right for your next Perl
project or can be used to tidy up existing code!

Merry Christmas to All, and to All a Good Night!
