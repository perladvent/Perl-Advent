=head1 Path::Tiny: The little module that keeps on giving

Do you have difficulty remembering all of the core modules that help you work
with path names and contents, their interfaces, and all the little edge cases
that you have to watch out for?  I sure do! But I have a new tool in my
toolbox that lets me forget about L<File::Spec>, L<File::Copy>, L<File::Path>,
L<File::Temp> and the rest — L<Path::Tiny>, by David Golden.  It's amazingly
full-featured for a module that can still rightfully claim the Tiny name.

For instance, you may be aware that it lets you deal with path strings in an
architecture-agnostic way, and stringifies as needed:

    #!perl
    my $path = path(qw(master_list 2013 North_America));

    # prints 'master_list/2013/North_America';
    say $path;

    # prints 'master_list/2013/North_America' on unix,
    #        'master_list\2013\North_America' on win32
    say $path->canonpath;

    # prints /home/santa/master_list/2013/North_America when $CWD is /home/santa
    say $path->absolute;

    # prints 'master_list/2013'
    say $path->parent;

    # prints 'master_list/2013/North_America/Vancouver/ETHER'
    say $path->child('Vancouver', 'ETHER');

Did you also know it can help you with creating temporary directories and
files, automatically respecting the C<TMPDIR> environment variable?

    #!perl
    my $tempdir = Path::Tiny->tempdir('delivery_list_XXXXXX');
    my $tempfile = Path::Tiny->tempfile(TEMPLATE => 'delivery_list_XXXXXX', suffix => '.bin');

Or that you can use it to easily process your files?

    #!perl
    foreach my $city_dir (path(qw(master_list 2013 North_America))->children)
    {
        foreach my $gift_path ($city_dir->children)
        {
            # $gift_path will be the same as from path(qw(master_list 2013 North_America Vancouver ETHER))
            process_giftlist($gift_path);
        }
    }

You can even traverse directories recursively:

    #!perl
    my @naughty;
    my $iter = path(qw(master_list 2013))->iterator({ recurse => 1 });
    while (my $path = $iter->())
    {
        # skip over directories
        next unless $path->is_file;

        push @naughty, $path and next if $path->parent->child('.naughty')->is_file;

        plan_delivery($path);
    }

And remove entire trees:

    #!perl
    # no gifts for you!
    foreach my $naughty_path (@naughty)
    {
        send_lump_of_coal_to($path->basename);
        $naughty_path->remove_tree;
    }

L<Path::Tiny> also makes creating files and directories a breeze:

    #!perl
    my $year = (localtime)[5] + 1900;    # or '2013'
    foreach my $child (keys %census)
    {
        my $gift_path = path('master_list', $year, $child->{region}, $child->{city}, $child->{name});

        # creates full directory heirarchy if it does not already exist
        $gift_path->mkpath;

        # append to existing file, or create a new one as needed
        my @gift_list = consult_elves_regarding($child);
        $gift_path->append_utf8({ locked => 1 }, \@gift_list);
    }

But what about processing file contents?  That's also a joy:

    #!perl
    sub process_giftlist
    {
        my $gift_path = shift;

        my $fh = $gift_path->openr_utf8;
        while (my $line = <$fh>) { ... }
    }

What a about a few more stocking stuffers?

Keep your filesystem clean by ensuring that locally-created scratch files are
in the tempdir:

    #!perl
    # Don't chdir if we're already in a descendant of the tempdir!
    chdir $tempdir unless $tempdir->subsumes(Path::Tiny->cwd);

Create a file anywhere in the system, without having to create intermediary
files:

    #!perl
    my $scratch_file = $tempdir->child('batch_01', 'scratchfile.txt')->touchpath;

Move a file for safe-keeping into a directory that may not yet exist:

    #!perl
    $scratch_file->move(Path::Tiny->rootdir('master_list', '2013', 'extras')->mkpath));

Create a digest of the file, for easily watching for other things changing the
file:

    #!perl
    foreach my $path (...)
    {
        my $digest = $path->digest;
        reprocess_file($path) if $digest ne ($digest{$path} // '');
        $digest{$path} = $digest;
    }


But this is my favourite feature of all, because it rolls up so many concerns
into one tidy little package... never again will you have to have to worry
about error-checking, encoding, line endings or anything else that might
distract us from gift preparation:

    #!perl
    my $file_contents = $gift_path->slurp_utf8;

Mmm, tasty L<Path::Tiny>!
