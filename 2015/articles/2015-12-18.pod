Title: Christmas Wishes

One of the problems with Santa's delivering presents to all the girls and boys
in the world was that when he arrived at midnight in New Zeland to deliver
presents to all the good girls and boys, it was twenty three and three quarter
hours earlier in Honlulu, barely even Christmas Eve and all the boys and girls
there were still making their last minute requests!

The elves had compensated somewhat by putting extra gifts in Santa's magic sack
of infinite holding, but updating the gift list in real time to tell Santa what
everyone wanted was becoming a serious problem:  The sat-phone could only
transmit so much data, and Santa was getting tired of flying around aimlessly
while he waited for the download to complete.

=head2 The Problem With JSON

Here's an example update to the gift list the elves can needed to send to Santa:

   #!perl
   my $updates = [
       {
           id => '79ABF5D8-9A75-4263-8F8F-A2346EDA62F7',
           wants => [
              'iPad Pro',
              'Modern Perl 4th Edition',
           ],
        },
        {
           id => '7593A066-3C83-4A9C-8A43-4F09D8693B15',
           wants => [
              'Pokemon Alpha-Sapphire',
              'Modeling Clay',
           ],
        },
        {
            id => '2A94FFDB-9FAB-440D-8C2A-D7ED40F30557',
            wants => [
                'My Two Front Teeth',
            ],
        },
   }

Traditionally the elves had been encoding this out with JSON to shoot over
the wire.

  #!perl
  use JSON::PP;
  my $bytes = encode_json $updates;
  say length($bytes) . ' bytes';

This prints C<268 bytes>.  Not so bad, but can the elves do better?

=head2 Introducing Sereal

Sereal is I<an efficient, compact-output, binary and feature-rich serialization
protocol>.  In other words it's a standard for bundling up a data structure
really small to send over the wire, and is just what the Elves are looking for!

=head2 Compression

Sereal has built in compression. Snappy compression should be enough in most
situations:

   #!perl
   use Sereal::Encoder qw(encode_sereal SRL_SNAPPY);

   my $bytes = encode_sereal(
      $updates,
      {
          compress => SRL_SNAPPY,
          compress_threshold => 0
      }
   );

   say length($bytes) . ' bytes';

This prints out the much improved C<233 bytes>.  For better compression we can
use Zlib (which is more CPU intensive, but right now the elves need every byte
they can get)

   #!perl
   use Sereal::Encoder qw(encode_sereal SRL_ZLIB);

   my $bytes = encode_sereal(
      $updates,
      {
          compress => SRL_ZLIB,
          compress_threshold => 0
      }
   );

   say length($bytes) . ' bytes';

This code prints out the even more improved C<205 bytes>.  Looking at this on a
graph we can see we've saved just short of quarter of the byte count over using
plain old JSON:

=head2 Scaling Up For More Impressive Results

The elves were concerned about how Sereal would behave when scaling up the size
of the data that was being sent - there are a lot of children in the world after
all. They decided to re-run the test with a bigger dataset.  Being thankful to
all the CPAN authors in the world Santa decided to give each and every one
either new copy of the Modern Perl 4th Edition book or a Round Tuit token:

   #!perl
   my $updates = [
      map {
        +{
           id => $_,
           wants => [
               rand > 0.5 ? 'Modern Perl 4th Edition' : 'A Round Tuit'
           ]
         }
      } (
        'E113BD23-E72A-4EC0-A57C-C4E868D9049C',
        '7F1AAB0C-4B85-4B42-9C8D-A41C6CF9D93E',
        ... # and 12483 other uuids
      )
   ];

Rerunning the above tests produced an even more impressive savings:

The elves had reduced the byte count by almost 94%!

=head2 Even More Compression

One of the elves decided to investigate ways to make the data that had to be
sent even smaller.  Noticing that many of the last minute present requests were
for this year's hot new toy, the elf suggested that the data structure have some
short cut code to avoid having to repeat the same string name of the toy over
and over again in the data that was sent over the wire.

Luckily for him, one of the other elves were paying close attention and before
he got to work it was pointed out that Sereal can be configured to do this
automatically for you!

The elves tried rerunning the CPAN authors data with the C<dedupe_strings> option enabled:

   #!perl
   my $bytes = encode_sereal(
      $updates,
      {
          compress => SRL_ZLIB,
          dedupe_strings => 1,
      }
   );

This resulted in even smaller bytesize

=for html
  <table class="pretty-table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
  <td>dedupe_strings</td>
  <td>Bytes</td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr class="alt">
  <td>disabled</td>
  <td>60207</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>enabled</td>
  <td>58537</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

=head2 Success

This year not only would the gift list update quicker, Santa's phone bill
would also be considerably less!
