Would it shock you to know that despite having created one hundred and fifteen
(and counting) Perl Advent Calendar entries over the years, I've never written
an article on one of the smallest, silliest, modules that I rely on every day?
A module that I can't debug my code without?

And the name of that module?  B<Acme::MetaSyntactic>.  Yes, that's right.  An
I<Acme> module, from the namespace on the CPAN that's traditionally reserved for
joke modules.  I'd better explain why I rely so heavily on one of these,
shouldn't I?

There was a time when, like a chump, I'd write statements like this throughout
my code:

    #!perl
    print STDERR "Here!\n";

And

    #!perl
    print STDERR "Got Here Also!\n";

This I<poor man's debugger> technique is surprisingly effective.  Unlike a real
debugger it works well with web applications, it doesn't require an external
module support (so in a pinch you can even use it on one of the production
servers you've temporarily stopped the load balancer sending live traffic to)
and can be left unattended to generate output on minutes long scripts while you
go and fetch a hot beverage.

So if this is so effective, why was I a chump for using it?  All that I<typing>.
Having to come up with I<unique new strings> to print out all the time...I can't
tell you the number of times I'd copy and pasted a C<print STDERR "Here!"> from
one place to another and then scratched my head wondering which I<Here> was
printing.

Lazyness is one of the virtues of a Perl programmer.  Surely we can automate
this?  You bet we can.

Acme::MetaSyntactic is a module that can create random memorable strings for
us and the Acme-MetaSyntactic-Themes distribution on the CPAN contains a vast
range of themes for it.  For example, using the gems theme:

    #!perl
    use Acme::MetaSyntactic qw(gems);
    say join ' ', metagems(3) for 1..5;

Produces output like so:

    ruby amethyst girasol
    moonstone ivory sugilite
    jadeite tiger_s_eye jasper
    beryl lapis_lazuli diamond

We can easily use this technique to write a tiny little Perl script that
outputs a print statement that contains unique-ish strings

    #!perl
    use Acme::MetaSyntactic qw(batman);
    say 'print STDERR "'. join(q{ }, metabatman(2)) . '";\\n';

Executing this we can see our print statement with awesome 60s Batman type
sound effects.

    print STDERR "wham_eth klonk\n";

But how do we automate inserting this in our Perl code?

=head2 Configuring Your Editor

Modern editors are amazing things, Turing complete little bundles of wonder
that can be configured to do almost anything, including executing a shell
script and inserting the output of the script into your source code.

I won't tell you what editor to use (and you emacs and vim users probably know
how to do this already) but I'll let you in on the secret of how I do this with
Sublime Text 3, my editor of choice.

Sublime Text 3 has a complex plug-in system written in Python in which I've
written many a tool.  But, fear not, I need not concern myself with a non-Perl
language in this Advent Calendar entry, for many existing plug-ins that can shell
out exist that can be installed with Package Control without having to write a
line of code.  Using the
L<External Command|https://packagecontrol.io/packages/External%20Command> plug-in
we can get our script to insert at the cursor every time we hit C<alt-shift-b>.

    #!vim json
    {
        "keys": ["alt+shift+b"],
        "caption": "print STDERR meta batman",
        "command": "insert_command_output",
        "args": { "cmdline": "/Users/mark/bin/printmetabatman" }
    }

=head2 Configuring Your Terminal Emulatator

So, why isn't running this in an editor sufficient?  If you only ever edit code
on your own box then everything is good...but what if you're logged into
a remote server via ssh that either doesn't run your editor or choice or isn't
configured to have Acme::MetaSyntactic or your editor configuration?

Rather than using the Terminal application bundled with OS X, these days I use
an open source replacement called L<iTerm 2|https://www.iterm2.com/>. As well as
having cool features like being able to open files you C<ls> with a click,
configurable highlighting of terminal output (to show where all the errors are
when you tail a log), and allowing programs you run in it to pop up
notifications outside the window, it also allows I<co-processes>.  In iTerm
parlance, co- processes are scripts that once launched get sent everything that
the terminal is outputting and and anything they output is typed back into the
terminal.

In our case, we want to simply want to execute our same two line Perl script as
a co-process so its output is typed at the terminal.  That can be done from
withing the C<Keys> tab of the application's preferences:

=head2 Making A OS X Service

What if we want to take it even further?  Have a keyboard shortcut that doesn't
insert the text in a particular application but inserts the text I<anywhere> on
OS X that OS X thinks it can take text input?

OS X Services are global menu items that can be triggered by clicking on the
title of the current running application next to the apple logo in the top left
corner of the screen and selecting them from the C<Services> menu underneath.
More importantly, they can also be assigned global keyboard shortcuts.

The Automator application that is provided by Apple can be used to create
Services that run Perl scripts:  Launch Automator and select "Service" to create
a new service.  Search for the C<Run Shell Script> action then configure it to
run the Perl script (you can write Perl code directly in this box and configure
it to be executed with C</usr/bin/perl>, but we're re-using the same script as
in the previous examples.)  Finally set it so the Service takes C<no input> and
tick the box so that C<Output replaces selected text>.

=for html
  <center><img src="automator.png" width="500" height="294"></center>

The service is installed as soon as you save it.

Once you have created the service you can then assign a keyboard shortcut to
it in System Preferences.  Select the C<Keyboard> icon, click on the C<Shortcuts>
tab and then pick C<Services> on the left.  Scroll down till you find your
service under C<Text> and click on the space to the right of the name to
assign the shortcut.

=head2 Keybord Maestro

You'll notice we If you were paying close attention you'll notice that
previously I said that a service can be used "anywhere on OS X that I<OS X
thinks it can take text input>". What does that mean?  It means that they can be
used anywhere that the application is using the standard libraries to create a
text input area. But not all applications use that (for example the previously
mentioned iTerm2 and Sublime Text don't use those, and the service cannot be
used within them.)

L<Keyboard Maestro|https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/> is a commercial
utility that can be used to control your Mac, and one of the many things it can
do is trigger a workflow whenever a key combination is pressed.  That workflow
can execute an external script and Keyboard Maestro can then simulate the keys
on your keyboard being pressed, meaning that the output from that script can
be typed anywhere in any application running on your Mac, if its explicitly
expecting it or not.

=head2 Typing Autocompletion

Another option to insert the text is to use a text expansion utility.  For
example, using the L<TextExpander|https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander>
program I can configure my computer so every time I type C<metaqq> it deletes
that text and quickly types the output of my Perl script:

=for html
  <center><img src="te.gif" width="355" height="130"></center>

Setting this kind of script up with TextExpander is trivial;  You just
create a new macro and click on the C<content> header and select C<Shell Script>
then enter the path to our existing script in the shebang line (or, you could
write the Perl shell script here, directly in the text box.)

=for html
  <center><img src="te.png" width="360" height="275"></center>

Keyboard Maestro is a little more complex to use than Text Expander but can also
be configured to do text expansion with a shell script.  It can even be
configured to match what typed text triggers the macro with regular expressions,
which allows you to have a very crude way to type in variables.  For example, to
produce a macro where we can type C<< meta<theme>qq >> to select any of the
intalled Acme::MetaSyntactic themes:

=for html
  <center><img src="km.gif"></center>

In order to work out what was typed in the script we need to set a variable
to the C<%TypedText%> temporary variable, and then access it via an environment
variable in our Perl script:

=head2 The True Perl Laziness

So today we have truly embraced the Perl concept of laziness.  Rather than have
to spend five seconds typing in a print statement, we've developed a Perl script
that generates suitable output for us and investigated at least six different
ways to trigger it on a Mac.  I'm sure you'll all agree that that's time
well spent.
