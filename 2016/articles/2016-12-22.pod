Title:  All I want for Christmas...Is Statistically Calcuable

Elladryl was always looking for ways to improve customer satisfaction,
and for years she'd been stumped by a particularly difficult to please
group of children. Well, actually, they weren't difficult I<per se>,
more like inscrutable. Some children were so polite or meek, that they
never told Santa what they wanted! Elladryl had tried everything: give
them a random toy, give them the most popular toy that year, give them
what their siblings or neighbors got to avoid envyE<hellip> none of it
worked. And since these kids were perpetually underwhelmed, some of the
I<scrooges> in accounting were proposing that they simply be given
leftover stock from previous years! There had to be a better way.

One day, while sitting in the break room staring at a bit of corporate
kitsch E<mdash> a poster proclaiming "Every child is as unique as a
snowflake "E<mdash> Elladryl muttered "poppycock." She was an avid
macro-photographer in the off-season, and more than once she'd snapped
a picture of very similar looking snowflakes. Of course, that was it!
She simply had to figure out which children were similar to those that
hadn't made a request, and she'd have an idea of what they might like
to receive. After a little digging around on CPAN, searching for various
keywords, she found L<Algorithm::KMeans>: a tool for clustering
multidimensional data. Perfect! In short, the module groups data points
(read children) together based on as many criteria as one cares to use,
such that the items in one group are more like one another than they are
anything else, a sort of L<multidimensional Voronoi diagram|http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/figs/s164-vd-bnd.gif>.

It's well known that Santa keeps psychological profiles of all the world's
children E<mdash> naughty or nice, I<et cetera et cetera> E<mdash> but that
data is closely guarded, and Elladryl would have to demonstrate the need
for and effectiveness of her idea. Fortunately, L<Algorithm::KMeans> has
the ability to create synthetic data sets for testing purposes. It also
has the ability determine the optimum number of clusters for a data set;
a somewhat slow process in which it assesses the quality of fit for dividing
the up into 2 through 16 clusters.

    use Algorithm::KMeans;

    Algorithm::KMeans->cluster_data_generator(
        input_parameter_file           => 'Big5.param',
        output_datafile                => 'Big5-Data.csv',
        number_data_points_per_cluster =>  128,
    );

After inputting some plausible parameters for the
L<big five personality traits|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits>,
Elladryl ran the auto-clusterer over her synthetic sample of 512 children and
was disappointed with the results: two clusters of 509 and 3 tots respectively.
What did she do wrong? After racking her brain and trying everything, on her
umpteenth run the clusterer created two similarly-sized groups. Success,
of a sort. There were clearly more than two types of children in the world,
nerd jokes about binary aside, so what had changed? It turns out in the
most recent run, while playing with the data, she had renormalized the
variables from 0 to 10 rather than 0 to 1. Interesting, for some reason the
algorithm seemed to be sensitive to the magnitude of the inputs. She rescaled
the data again, from 0 to 100, and ended up with a much more plausible result
of four clusters. Huzzah!

It's not clear why the clusterer should care about anything more than the
relative values of variables, but the important thing is that it appears to
work. Elladryl could now make a case to the head elf for access to more data,
but she was sure he would agree, and that many more children would be happy
this holiday. Of course, even with this break through, she still had plenty
of experimenting left to perform. Should the silent children receive the
same toy as a randomly selected child in the same cluster? The most popular
toy in the cluster? Or perhaps the clusters could be sub-divided even further?
After all, since her tool will be processing hundreds of millions of record,
she'll have to be somewhat frugal in what variables she can use. But perhaps
a coarse clusterer using some high-level psychosocial data could be followed
up with another pass using additional variables to create finer sub-divisions.
