Title: Using PPI for static analyzis
Topic: PPI
Author: Nicolas R. <atoomic@cpan.org>

=pod

This article is based on a talk I presented this year in Orlando
at The Perl Conference 2016 (formerly known as YAPC::NA 2016).

The talk itself was oriented on how and why to find dead code in a program.
It's very common that a program loads tens (if not more) modules where
in its life cycle only a few of them are either used or partially used.

All of this 'unused' code could impact memory and performance of your program.
Most of the time if your program is run as a daemon, it does not really matter,
or at least less. But if it's a short run... then it can be interesting.

Finding 'dead code' by static analyzis is vowed to failure and comes with its own
caveats due to the dynamic nature of perl... which can create/call functions
at run time... so you cannot know for sure that a specific function 
will never be called.

Rather than being a duplicate of the talk which you can find online (view links at
the end of the article). I'm going to show some PPI usages after introducing
the basics of INC.

=head2 INC Basics

Perl uses two versions of INC: @INC as an array and %INC as a hash.
As for any other variables sharing the same name but using 
a different 'type' these two are differents.

=for :list
* @INC: an array which contains path where to look for new modules
* %INC: a hash which saved the location of each already loaded module

=head3 Sample usage of @INC and %INC

Note that you can check at anytime the default value of @INC, by running
'perl -V' command. This is depending on your environment variables
as the custom PERL5LIB path are taken into account.

    > echo $PERL5LIB
    /Users/nicolas/.dotfiles/perl-must-have/lib:/Users/nicolas/perl5/lib/perl5/

    > perl -V
    ...
      @INC:
    /Users/nicolas/.dotfiles/perl-must-have/lib
    /Users/nicolas/perl5/lib/perl5/
    /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/site_perl/5.22.1/darwin-2level
    /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/site_perl/5.22.1
    /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/5.22.1/darwin-2level
    /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/5.22.1
    .


You can also display the content of @INC and %INC directly from your program

  #!perl
  use v5.022;

  use warnings;
  use strict;
  use Simple::Accessor;

  say q{# @INC:};
  map { say $_ } @INC;

  say qq{\n}, q{# %INC:};
  foreach ( sort keys %INC ) {
      say $_, ' => ', $INC{$_};
  }

When run on my local system the output looks like this, it should be similar on yours.

  # @INC:
  /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/site_perl/5.22.1/darwin-2level
  /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/site_perl/5.22.1
  /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/5.22.1/darwin-2level
  /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/5.22.1
  .

  # %INC:
  Simple/Accessor.pm => /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/site_perl/5.22.1/Simple/Accessor.pm
  strict.pm => /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/5.22.1/strict.pm
  warnings.pm => /Users/nicolas/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.22.1/lib/5.22.1/warnings.pm


Note that the keys of %INC are not using the module name as 'Foo::Bar' but the short path version
as 'Foo/Bar.pm'. Remember that a file can provide multiple packages.

=head3 Messing around with @INC and %INC

Both @INC and %INC are read/write... which means you can cheat and lie to perl
at run time, by customizing them.

=over

=item Customizing @INC

By tweaking @INC you can change the behavior of a program by forcing it to 
load modules from a different path... or even do not look in a generic path

The most common use case, is to add one known path to it like in this sample,
where a custom path is added in first position of @INC.

   #!perl
   
   BEGIN { unshift @INC, "/search/in/this/path/first" }
   
   use My::Module ();   

=item Customizing %INC

Updating %INC is less common but also provides some great value,
ony use it with care, but this is an easy way to avoid loading
a useless (not used during the life of your program) module.

   #!perl

   BEGIN { $INC{"Useless/Module.pm"} = '__FAKE__'; }

   # this use or require will not try to load the module

   use Useless::Module;
   require Useless::Module;

=back

=head2 Listing dependencies of a script

We now know that modules loaded by a script are advertised in %INC.
If we could read %INC just before the program starts, this could
gives a picture of all required modules at this time.
(note that some module might be lazy loaded later...)

This is exactly what we can achieve using a CHECK block.

    package Devel::ListDeps;

    CHECK {
      foreach my $module ( sort keys %INC ) {
        # exclude ourself: could also use __PACKAGE__
        next if $module eq 'Devel/ListDeps.pm'; 
        print qq{$module\n};
      }
    }

    1;

Let's now use it on a very simple program which is just using strict
and warnings.

  #!perl

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  print qq{hello World\n}; # or say

We are here using -d to load our Devel package
(if the module is not in your @INC you might need to use -Ilib to load it)

  > perl -c -d:ListDeps samples/hello-world.pl
  strict.pm
  warnings.pm
  samples/hello-world.pl syntax OK

As we can see we can get the list of dependencies from a script 
without altering it.
Also note that the program was not executed as we just asked perl to
run with -c to stop after the CHECK block. "Hello World" is not printed.

We can also check that this is listing recursive dependencies by using
something little more complex.

    #!perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Test::More;

    print qq{hello World\n}; # or say

We can see that Test::More is listed as part of dependencies but
other modules coming from Test::More are also now loaded.

    > perl -Ilib -c -d:ListDeps samples/hello-world.pl
    Config.pm
    Exporter.pm
    Exporter/Heavy.pm
    PerlIO.pm
    Test/Builder.pm
    Test/Builder/Module.pm
    Test/More.pm
    strict.pm
    vars.pm
    warnings.pm
    warnings/register.pm
    samples/hello-world.pl syntax OK

As shown in the talk we could then wrap this in a script
that could remove the last line and convert the short path
to a package namespce to be more human friendly.

Then we could use it this way:

    > ./perl-dependencies samples/hello-world.pl
    Config
    Exporter
    Exporter::Heavy
    PerlIO
    Test::Builder
    Test::Builder::Module
    Test::More
    strict
    vars
    warnings
    warnings::register

=head2 Memory profiling

  Now that we are able to list all dependencies from a script.
  It would be nice to know the memory required by each module.

  For this purpose I'm going to use a oneliner, which mainly
  works on linux system. Needs some adjustment on macos or other OS.

    > perl -e 'print qx{grep VmRSS /proc/$$/status}'
    VmRSS:      1836 kB

  On linux systems this metric is globally stable

    > for i in $(seq 1 4); do perl -e 'print qx{grep VmRSS /proc/$$/status}'; done
    VmRSS:      1836 kB
    VmRSS:      1836 kB
    VmRSS:      1832 kB
    VmRSS:      1836 kB

=head3 Tracking memory usage for one module

  We can now track memory usage for each individual module

    > perl -MCarp -e 'print qx{grep VmRSS /proc/$$/status}'
    VmRSS:      2872 kB

    > perl -MData::Dumper -e 'print qx{grep VmRSS /proc/$$/status}'
    VmRSS:      3728 kB

    > perl -MMoose -e 'print qx{grep VmRSS /proc/$$/status}'
    VmRSS:     16596 kB

=head3 Tracking memory usage for one module

  We can also check the memory used by more than a single module
  using the same oneliner.

    > perl -MCarp -MData::Dumper -e 'print qx{grep VmRSS /proc/$$/status}'
    VmRSS:      3752 kB

  When adding Carp to Data::Dumper the total memory footprint
  is the same as when using Data::Dumper by itself.
  The reason is that Data::Dumper is also using Carp

    > perl -MData::Dumper -E 'say $INC{"Carp.pm"}'
    /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/perl/524/lib64/perl5/5.24.1/Carp.pm

  Adding Moose to Data::Dumper, we can  notice that the memory used
  is higher than Moose by itself but still below the sum

    > perl -MData::Dumper -MMoose -e 'print qx{grep VmRSS /proc/$$/status}'
    VmRSS:     17132 kB

  We cannot do the simple math addition to know the memory used by multiple modules.

    Memory(Moose) < Memory( Moose & Data::Dumper )  < Memory(Moose) + Memory(Data::Dumper)

  Perl itself as its own startup memory cost and modules could also used shared dependencies
  so we cannot count them more than once... as once a module is loaded, it's in and
  can be used at no additional cost by any other module.


=head3 Tracking memory increase

  Then come the next idea.. what about running the same oneliner each time a module is loaded ?
  Is it possible ? Yes we can use a custom DB:DB function which would be able to track all calls.

  We could use either a change of state of %INC or also caller to know which file was just loaded.
  This script is pretty long and still need some tweaks but this is the main idea:

  This is the current version 

    package Devel::ListDepsDetails;
    
    BEGIN {
        sub get_memory {
            my $m;
            if ( -e q{/proc} ) { # unix
                $m = qx{grep VmRSS /proc/$$/status};
            } else { # mac os x (not consistent)
                $m = qx{ps -o rss -p $$ | tail -1};
            }
            return int $m;
        }

        my @inc = sort { length $b <=> length $a or $a cmp $b } @INC;
        sub short  {
            my $s = shift;

            foreach my $in ( @inc ) {
                next unless $s =~ s{^$in/?}{};
                
                if ( $s =~ qr{\.pm$} ) {
                    $s =~ s{\.pm$}{};
                    $s =~ s{/+}{::}g;
                }
                last;
            }

            return $s;
        }

        my %seen;
        my $total_mem = 0;
        sub DB::DB {
            my ( $package, $file, $line ) = caller;

            return if $file eq '-e' || $file eq '-E';
            return if $file =~ qr{^\(eval};

            return if $seen{$file}++;

            $file ||= '';

            my $mem   = get_memory();
            my $delta = $mem - $total_mem;
            $total_mem = $mem;
            if ( keys %seen == 1 ) {
                print "# [delta => total RSS in kB] module name (or eval)\n";
            }

            # try to guess where it comes from (manual longmess :-)
            my ( $frompkg, $fromfile, $fromline ) = caller();
            my $max = 1_000;
            foreach my $level ( 0 .. $max ) {
                my ( $package, $filename, $line ) = caller($level);
                last unless defined $filename;
                if ( $fromfile ne $filename ) {    # when the filename differs, we know where it comes from
                    ( $frompkg, $fromfile, $fromline ) = ( $package, $filename, $line );
                    last;
                }
                if ( $level == $max ) {
                    ( $frompkg, $fromfile, $fromline ) = ( '????', '????', '?' );
                }
            }

            print sprintf( "[%5s => %8d] %-50s from %-30s at line %d\n", ( $delta > 0 ? '+' : '' ) . $delta, $mem, ( short($file) || 'undef' ), short($fromfile), $fromline );

            return;
        }

    }

    CHECK { exit }

    1;

  We can then use it this way for example, either loading a script or directly on a module
  and each time we see a new file we check the memory and check how much it was increased.

    Use some CORE modules


  From there we can do some human check on the top modules and see if these are really required
  in the context of our program or if we can replace it with a less intrusive module...
  Most of the time you probably only care about modules used by your own code.

=head2 Finding unused subroutines using PPI

  Now that we know that a module can brings dependencies, and these could use some extra memory.
  It would be nice to be able to detect if some of them are useless.
  
  After some googling, I could quickly find a L<solution from brian d. foy: Finding Unused Subroutines, but with PPI|http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2012/07/finding-unused-subroutines-but-with-ppi.html>
  which uses L<PPI|https://metacpan.org/pod/PPI>.

  PPI is a perl parser which tokenizes a source code to convert it to a list of 'tokens' making
  any code manipulation easier than playing with regexp and other complex methods.
  After analyzing the document tree, you can add/remove/update some tokens (like for example comments, pods...), 
  then later safely render it as a source code using the Lexer.
  
  You can read more about PPI from its perldoc itself, where you could learn two meanings for PPI
  "Parse::Perl::Isolated" but also 'I Parse Perl' (if you read it from right to left)

  Here is the main idea behind this PPI analyzis:

=for :list
* 1. Parse a script using PPI 
* 2. get the list of all defined functions
* 3. get the list of all function used
*  .i   can be a reference to the function: \&foo
*  .ii  direct call to function: foo()
*  .iii find functions used as bareword: foo
* 4. do the diff between the two list to guess the unused functions

  brian d foy solution is very smart, and works pretty well on small scripts.
  
  Its main limitation comes from the fact that the analyze is only performed in the scope of your program.
  This can be solved by doing a fatpacking of your script.
  The second problem is that it should loop after removing functions 
  as this could result in some extra optimizations. One way to do this is to perform the removal using PPI
  then perform a new analyzis.

  For example in this case, 'c' is the function called which requires only 'd'
  The algorithm described above will detect that 'b' as a function is declared and never used
  but will not be able to do the same for 'a' as it's used inside b.  

    #!perl
    
    use strict;
    use warnings;  

    sub a {}
    sub b { a() }
    sub c { d() }
    sub d { 1 }

    c();

  We could simply fix this by performing a loop on the program.
  Until we cannot remove any extra function or we reach a stable
  state, were nothing new need to be removed.
  
  Then perform an analyzis on the updated document.
  (can be performed without writing the updated file to disk, but this
  allow an easier way to debug to write it each time)

  We can also add an extra check like a 'perl -c' between each iteration
  to be sure we are not doing something bad.

    #!perl

    # this is a pseudo code
    
    my $doc = PPI::Document->new( $script );
    my $step;
    while ( 1 ) { # analyze required
      my @remove_subs = $doc->remove_unused_subs();
      last unless scalar @removed_subs
        or !cmp_bag(\@removed_subs, \@previous_state);
      @previous_state = @remove_subs;
      ++$step;
      $doc->update_and_write_to( "$script.step-$step" );
      # reread the file
      $doc = PPI::Document->new( "$script.step-$step" );
    }

=head3 basic modulino to play with PPI

Let's try to package this in Object Oriented way, and give it a try 
with a program that could strip comments and pods from a script

    package Analyze;

When used like this, a new file is going to be written on disk

=head3 PPI how to get the list of functions defined

A function is described in PPI by a 'PPI::Statement::Sub',
we should exclude from this list the reserved one like 
BEGIN, CHECK... 

Note: this code is extending the previous packages described above.

    package Analyze;

    ...    
    # Get all of the subroutine definitions
    sub _build_subs {
        my $self = shift;

        my %subs;

        my $all_ppi_subs = $self->Document->find(
            sub {
                $_[1]->isa('PPI::Statement::Sub')
                  # not a BEGIN, CHECK, UNITCHECK, INIT and END,
                  && !$_[1]->reserved()
            }
        ) || [];

        foreach my $sub (@$all_ppi_subs) {
            my $name = $sub->name;
            $subs{$name} = $sub;
        }

        debug "* All sub definitions: ", sort keys %subs;

        return \%subs;
    }

This is good but the problem here is that these two functions
will have the same name...

    package Foo; sub hello { }
    package Bar; sub hello { }

So we would like to know in which package the function is defined, 
then use its fullname Foo::hello, Bar::hello or main::hello.

=head3 PPI getting the package name of a function

We need a way to get the package name from a PPI element

    my $namespace = eval { $elt->parent->find_first('PPI::Statement::Package')->namespace };

In some cases this is unfortunately not providing the information we would expect..
We can come with our own workaround...  and save the begin and end line 
for each packages so it will be easy to know where a function is located if we 
can know which line it was defined.

Let's add an attribute 'packages' to the Analyze class and save the start and end
line for each packages. (note that a package namespace can be use more than once )

    # do not cache the value as when removing a doc, cache needs to be cleared
    sub _build_packages {
        my $self = shift;

        # use an array and not a hash
        #   as a package (like main or any other) can be defined multiple times
        my @packages;

        # find return the elements sorted
        my $search = $self->Document->find('PPI::Statement::Package') || [];

        foreach my $pkg (@$search) {
            if ( scalar @packages ) {
                $packages[-1]->{'to'} = $pkg->line_number - 1;
            }
            push @packages, { name => $pkg->namespace, from => $pkg->line_number, to => 0, file_scoped => $pkg->file_scoped };
        }

        return \@packages;
    }

Now that we have that information it becomes easy to know in which namespace the function
was declared. Rather than using '$sub->name' we could use 'get_package_for($sub)' 
with the following

    sub get_package_for {
        my ( $self, $elt ) = @_;

        my $line         = $elt->line_number;
        my $all_packages = $self->packages; # coming from previous function _build_packages
        foreach my $v (@$all_packages) {
            my $pkg = $v->{name};
            if ( $v->{from} < $line && ( $v->{to} == 0 || $line <= $v->{to} ) ) {
              return $pkg;
            }
        }
        
        return 'main'; # default
    }

=head3 PPI get list of methods used as function call

If your script is using object oriented style, then you will
quickly have functions calls instead of method calls.

'$object->foo()' rather than 'foo()'

We cannot do anything for something like '$object->$foo()',
but we can try to check all static functions calls trying
to find the PPI::Token::Operator '->'

    # list of methods with the scope where they might be used
    sub _build_methods {
        my $self = shift;

        my @methods;

        my $search = $self->Document->find(
            sub {
                $_[1]->isa('PPI::Token::Operator')
                  && $_[1]->content eq '->';
            }
        ) || [];

        foreach my $op (@$search) {
            next unless eval { $op->snext_sibling->class eq 'PPI::Token::Word' };

            # maybe something special for nw ?
            push @methods, $op->snext_sibling->content;
        }

        debug "* All methods: ", sort @methods;

        #note explain $all_statements;
        return \@methods;
    }

=head3 PPI detect function used as reference or stash

We can get the list of symbols, functions not called with parens
but with &foo, \&foo, *foo...

The code is not much more complex than finding defined functions.

    # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
    # find the sub calls that use &
    # &foo
    # &foo()
    # \&foo
    # *foo
    sub _build_symbols {
        my $self = shift;

        my @symbols;

        my $search = $self->Document->find(
            sub {
                $_[1]->isa('PPI::Token::Symbol')
                  && ( $_[1]->symbol_type eq '&'
                    || $_[1]->symbol_type eq '*' );
            }
        ) || [];

        foreach my $elt (@$search) {
            my $name = $elt->content =~ s/\A[&*]//r;    # /

            if ( $name !~ qr{::} ) {
                $name = $self->get_package_for($elt) . '::' . $name;
            }

            push @symbols, $name;
        }

        @symbols = sort @symbols;
        debug "* All symbols: @symbols";

        return \@symbols;
    }

=head3 PPI find the sub calls that use parens

Building the list of function called with some parens
is not more complex than listing all defined functions.
We need to find a 'Token::Word' followed by an open paren.

The code try to get the fullname of the function depending if it's
used as foo() or Bar::foo()

    # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
    # find the sub calls that use parens
    # foo()
    #   foo( @args )
    sub _build_list {
        my $self = shift;

        my @list;
        my $search = $self->Document->find(
            sub {
                $_[1]->isa('PPI::Token::Word')
                  && $_[1]->snext_sibling
                  && $_[1]->snext_sibling->isa('PPI::Structure::List');
            }
        ) || [];

        foreach my $elt (@$search) {
            my $name = $elt->literal;
            if ( $name !~ qr{::} ) {
                $name = $self->get_package_for($elt) . '::' . $name;
            }
            push @list, $name;
        }

        debug "* All list: @list";

        return \@list;
    }

=head3 PPI find the sub calls that are barewords

Very similar to the other list of functions called
we can ubild the list of functions used as barewords.

    # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
    # find the sub calls that are barewords
    # foo
    # foo + bar
    # but not
    # use vars qw( baz );
    # sub quux { ... }
    sub _build_barewords {
        my $self = shift;

        my %reserved = map { $_, $_ } qw( use vars sub my BEGIN INIT new );
        my @barewords = map { $_->literal }
          grep {
            # Take out the Words that are preceded by 'sub'
            # That is, take out the subroutine definitions
            # I couldn't get this to work inside the find()
            my $previous  = $_->previous_sibling;
            my $sprevious = $_->sprevious_sibling;

            !( blessed($previous) && blessed($sprevious) && $previous->isa('PPI::Token::Whitespace') && $sprevious->isa('PPI::Token::Word') && $sprevious->literal eq 'sub' )

          } @{
            $self->Document->find(
                sub {
                    $_[1]->isa('PPI::Token::Word')
                      && $_[1]->next_sibling->isa(
                        qw(
                          PPI::Token::Whitespace
                          PPI::Token::Structure
                          PPI::Token::List
                          PPI::Token::Operator
                          )
                      ) && ( !exists $reserved{ $_[1]->literal } );
                }
              )
              || []
          };

        debug "* All barewords: @barewords";

        push @barewords, sort keys %reserved;

        return \@barewords;
    }

=head2 Combining everything togeteher

We can now list used and defined functions, 
we still need a few helpers around it.

=head3 Get the list of used functions

Getting the list of all used functions then become very easy,
we just need to combine, symbols, list and barewords.

    sub get_used_sub {
        my $self = shift;

        my $symbols   = $self->symbols   // [];
        my $list      = $self->list      // [];
        my $barewords = $self->barewords // [];

        my %used = map { $_ => 1 } ( @$symbols, @$list, @$barewords );
        debug "* All used:", map { ( ' ', $_ ) } sort @{ [ keys %used ] };

        return \%used;
    }

We also need an additional helper to check if a function
is used as a method call

    sub is_used_method {
        my ( $self, $sub ) = @_;
        my $methods = $self->methods;

        return scalar grep { $sub =~ qr{::$_$} } @$methods;
    }


=head3 Removing unused functions

So all we need to do after creating a PPI doc using the Analyze module
is ask: 

=for :list
* what are the defined functions
* what are the used functions
* remove any defined function which is not used or not used a as a method
* delete the function from the PPI tree (except if it's blacklisted)

    sub remove_unused_subs {
        my $self = shift;

        my $subs = $self->subs;           # all subs
        my $used = $self->get_used_sub;

        # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
        # The unused have to be the left over ones
        # exception for methods:
        #   if a method is called on any object do not remove the function (can be improve for new & co)
        my @unused = sort grep { !exists $used->{$_} && !$self->is_used_method($_) } keys %$subs;

        debug "* All unused: @unused";

        my @removed;

        foreach my $sub (@unused) {
            next if $self->is_blacklist_sub($sub);

            if ( !defined $subs->{$sub} ) {
                debug "error: sub '$sub' not defined";
                next;
            }
            $subs->{$sub}->delete;
            push @removed, $sub;
        }

        # return removed sub list
        return @removed;
    } 


=head2 In Conclusion

We've seen in a first part that each module comes with its own memory cost.
In a second part we can now remove unused functions from a script, after
fatpacking it. Even if in some cases the result script works this should
probably still mainly be used as advice on how to refactor your code.

Detecting dead code with static analyzis is prone to errors due to the
dynamic nature of perl. $function() or $object->$method()...
As this could potentially come from the current ENV we have no accurate
way to perform a safe removal.

This method comes with its own limits, as it's performed as a static analyzis.
Another very interesting approach to this problem would be to analyze what happens
at run time ! and see what code path are triggered in the life (minutes,hours,weeks...)
of a program. And this is exactly what is done by Gonzalo via Devel::QuickCover.

You can play with the scripts described here available from the github repository.
They are in a quick&dirty mode, and could be improved in many ways but can stil 
provide a first approach to play with PPI.
