=head1 Finding presents instead of searching

Many children are under the assumption that Santa needs to work only
one day a year, when he distributes all the presents across the world. But
there is a lot of work that has to go into the preparation for this day.
Especially the choice of presents is an issue - while Santa knows who's been
naughty and who's been nice, he also has a list of the wishes of each child.
Santa also needs to monitor closely the demand and availability of presents
to match the wishes to the gifts.

Of course, Santas suppliers provide even
the most festive descriptions of the items.  The sheer supply
of possible gifts makes it difficult even
for Santa and his elves to remember the numbering schemes
and descriptions of the various items. And as the wishes and potential
presents come in at a time when the preparations are already in full swing
and Christmas is close, there is little time to dedicate elves to categorizing
the gifts.

=head2 Finding things

Ideally, any of the elves could use some kind of search engine
to find an appropriate present for a child.
Of course, companies like Google already provide a solution to finding the most
appropriate thing in the stack of proposed gifts for a wish of a child. But
Santa is peculiar about sharing his knowledge with others. While he knows who's
going to get their wish and who's going to get coal, he feels that sharing that
knowledge with other parties is not a good approach. What is known at the
North Pole stays at the North Pole.

So his approach is to build his own search engine.

=head2 Parts

The search engine consists of three parts, the Crawler, the Index and
the Searchform.

=head3 Crawler

Most catalogues come in as files on the filesystem, one file per
potential present.
The letters and wishlists all get stored in a large IMAP server.
The crawler is then responsible for reading all the information about gifts
and storing it in the index. Currently, the module comes with two separate
crawlers, one for the filesystem and one for an IMAP store.
Both crawlers take all items,
read them and extract the text from them and write them to the search index.

Santa wants to store some key facts as metadata with every document. For example
the author and sent date are extracted for every wishlist. Imagine giving a gift
for a 40-year old to their 8 year old self.

=head3 Index

The search index is provided by the Elasticsearch search index, with
L<Search::Elasticsearch> as the Perl interface. The index is a data structure
that allows for quick retrieval of documents given some words that are
associated with the documents. 
When storing the document information, Elasticsearch also adds more data
like synonyms so that the wish for I<a tricycle> can also find
I<ASIN20161225, vehicle, three wheeled> or other synonyms.

=head3 Searchform

The front end is provided by a Dancer application. It consists mostly
of a form field where elves enter the wish and submit the query. The L<Dancer>
application ties together the Elasticsearch index and search functionality
and returns word completion and matching documents for each query.
