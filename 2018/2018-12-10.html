<h1 class='title'>Christmas Tree Babbles</h1>
<div class='subtitle'>Babble - 2018-12-10</div>

<div class='pod'><p>Yesterday&#39;s exercise in getting a script runnable on an older version of perl had introduced the elves to App::sigfix, a tool that could transform their source code so that the subroutine signatures they&#39;d been using would be removed and replaced with shim code that could allow their transformed code to run on older versions of perl.</p>

<p>App::sigfix was just the forerunner of several similar tools that they were starting to learn about and take advantage of.</p>

<h3 id="Babel">Babel</h3>

<p>As much as the elves loved Perl, they, like most programmers, actually coded in several languages. One of their most used was JavaScript. JavaScript as a programming language has evolved over the years, but if it still has to run on older webbrowsers the code that is served on the webserver has to be written in the old and outdated dialect of JavaScript.</p>

<p>To help with this in the JavaScript world they have a tool called <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>. Babel is able to translate modern idiomatic ES6 style JavaScript code like this:</p>

<table class='code-listing'><tr><td class='line-numbers'><br /><code>1:&nbsp;<br />2:&nbsp;<br />3:&nbsp;<br />4:&nbsp;</code><br />&nbsp;</td><td class='code'><br /><code>($ =&gt; $(() =&gt; <span class="synIdentifier">{</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="synStatement">const</span> foo = $(<span class="synConstant">'#foo'</span>)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foo.on(<span class="synConstant">'click'</span>, () =&gt; console.log(<span class="synConstant">'foo'</span>))<br /><span class="synIdentifier">}</span>))(jQuery)</code><br />&nbsp;</td></table>

<p>Into more traditional JavaScript like this:</p>

<table class='code-listing'><tr><td class='line-numbers'><br /><code>1:&nbsp;<br />2:&nbsp;<br />3:&nbsp;<br />4:&nbsp;<br />5:&nbsp;<br />6:&nbsp;<br />7:&nbsp;<br />8:&nbsp;</code><br />&nbsp;</td><td class='code'><br /><code>(<span class="synIdentifier">function</span> ($) <span class="synIdentifier">{</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="synStatement">return</span> $(<span class="synIdentifier">function</span> () <span class="synIdentifier">{</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="synIdentifier">var</span> foo = $(<span class="synConstant">'#foo'</span>);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foo.on(<span class="synConstant">'click'</span>, <span class="synIdentifier">function</span> () <span class="synIdentifier">{</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="synStatement">return</span> console.log(<span class="synConstant">'foo'</span>);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="synIdentifier">}</span>);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="synIdentifier">}</span>);<br /><span class="synIdentifier">}</span>)(jQuery);</code><br />&nbsp;</td></table>

<p>Typically this is run with a tool like gulp whenever the JavaScript file is saved (or whatever other flavor of the month is in vogue in the JavaScript world this week), producing a shippable version that can be tested in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="Babble">Babble</h3>

<p>Babble is a Perl framework for essentially doing the same thing - taking Perl code and transpiling it into Perl code that can run on older versions of perl.</p>

<p>It can run in various modes. For example, it can run in a kind of Just in Time mode where the source code is transformed on the client computer (Babble itself along with its non-core dependencies is written in pure Perl code suitable for running on very old versions of perl):</p>

<table class='code-listing'><tr><td class='line-numbers'><br /><code>1:&nbsp;<br />2:&nbsp;<br />3:&nbsp;<br />4:&nbsp;<br />5:&nbsp;<br />6:&nbsp;<br />7:&nbsp;<br />8:&nbsp;<br />9:&nbsp;<br />10:&nbsp;</code><br />&nbsp;</td><td class='code'><br /><code><span class="comment">#!/usr/bin/perl<br /></span><br /><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="pragma">strict</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="pragma">warnings</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><br /><span class="comment"># enable the ::DefinedOr filter to change all the //<br /></span><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="word">Babble::Filter</span> <span class="words">qw(::DefinedOr)</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><br /><span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="symbol">$name</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="core">shift</span><span class="structure">()</span> <span class="operator">//</span> <span class="double">&quot;World&quot;</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><span class="word">print</span> <span class="double">&quot;Hello $name\n&quot;</span><span class="structure">;</span></code><br />&nbsp;</td></table>

<p>The Babble::Filter command transforms the source code as it&#39;s executed so this code will run versions of perl that don&#39;t support the defined-or operator <code>//</code>. In fact, the code that perl will see when it executes the script will actually look like this:</p>

<table class='code-listing'><tr><td class='line-numbers'><br /><code>1:&nbsp;<br />2:&nbsp;<br />3:&nbsp;<br />4:&nbsp;<br />5:&nbsp;<br />6:&nbsp;<br />7:&nbsp;<br />8:&nbsp;<br />9:&nbsp;<br />10:&nbsp;</code><br />&nbsp;</td><td class='code'><br /><code><span class="comment">#!/usr/bin/perl<br /></span><br /><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="pragma">strict</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="pragma">warnings</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><br /><span class="comment"># enable the ::DefinedOr filter to change all the //<br /></span><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="word">Babble::Filter</span> <span class="words">qw(::DefinedOr)</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><br /><span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="symbol">$name</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="structure">(</span><span class="word">map</span> <span class="operator">+</span><span class="structure">(</span><span class="core">defined</span><span class="structure">(</span><span class="magic">$_</span><span class="structure">)</span> <span class="operator">?</span> <span class="magic">$_</span> <span class="operator">:</span> <span class="double">&quot;World&quot;</span><span class="structure">)</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="core">shift</span> <span class="structure">())[</span><span class="number">0</span><span class="structure">];</span><br /><span class="word">print</span> <span class="double">&quot;Hello $name\n&quot;</span><span class="structure">;</span></code><br />&nbsp;</td></table>

<p>Which isn&#39;t the most readable code...but it&#39;s not designed for you, it&#39;s designed for very old versions of perl!</p>

<h3 id="Source-Filters">Source Filters?</h3>

<p>Perl has had source filters for countless years now, modules that can programmatically alter the source code as perl compiles. What makes Babble so different?</p>

<p>Normally source filters work by applying a dumb regular expression to the source code. They search for a matching string and then replace it with something else. They have no idea of the context the string is being used in - for example, if the string is in the middle of a string or heredoc - so are often fooled into doing the wrong thing. Worse, multiple source filters don&#39;t play well together - source filter A doesn&#39;t like the unfiltered input designed to be processed by source filter B, and source filter B doesn&#39;t like the unfiltered input designed to be processed by source filter A.</p>

<p>Under the hood Babble uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/PPR">PPR</a>, a set of grammars for the Perl programming language. This solves the context problem - rather than searching for a string to replace in isolation, Babble matches the entire document. Babble plugins are also able to play together so you can have multiple plugins transforming the same source; A Babble plugin works by changing the way the grammar is matched and interpreted, meaning essentially Babble ends up transforming the source for all plugins together rather than forcing one plugin to deal with the input for another.</p>

<h3 id="Shipping-Transformed-Code">Shipping Transformed Code</h3>

<p>Earlier I mentioned that you can run Babble in different modes. What&#39;s the other option?</p>

<p>Rather than having Babble transform the code in Just In Time mode, you can transpile the source code on your local machine and then ship that transformed code to the end user. This has the advantage that your end user doesn&#39;t have to have to install the Babble infrastructure, and it&#39;ll speed up startup time for your script.</p>

<p>Transformation of source code is easy:</p>

<pre><code>    perl -MBabble::Filter=::DefinedOr -pe babble hello.pl</code></pre>

<p>Since very early versions of perl 5, Perl 5 has had the ability to use <code>.pmc</code> files. If a <code>.pmc</code> file is located in the same directory as a <code>.pm</code> file then perl will load the <code>.pmc</code> file in preference to the <code>.pm</code> file - meaning it&#39;s possible to ship <i>Perl module compiled</i> code that you&#39;ve created with Babble alongside the original source code.</p>

<pre><code>    perl -MBabble::Filter=::DefinedOr -pe babble MyModule.pm &gt; MyModule.pmc</code></pre>

<p>Of course, running the above command for each module you want to ship will get tedious soon, and is an error prone technique (you&#39;re likely forget once and ship a <code>.pmc</code> that&#39;s not a transformed version of the <code>.pm</code>) What you need is a build system that handles all of this for you.</p>

<p>The most popular module build system for Perl <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a> is able to support Babble with the <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Babble">Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Babble</a> plugin. Simply add the following to your <code>dist.ini</code></p>

<pre><code>    [Babble]
    plugin = ::DefinedOr</code></pre>

<p>And now whenever you execute <code>dzil build</code> Babble will do the transformation for you.</p>

<h3 id="Whats-Possible-with-Babble-today">What&#39;s Possible with Babble today?</h3>

<p>Babel is very much an experimental tool, and as such should be treated with extreme care. On an experimental basis Babble can do a bunch of things today:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Babble::Plugin::CoreSignatures</dt>
<dd>

<p>Bring support for subroutine signatures to older versions of perl.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Babble::Plugin::DefinedOr</dt>
<dd>

<p>Bring support for defined-or (<code>//</code>) to older versions of perl.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Babble::Plugin::PostfixDeref</dt>
<dd>

<p>Bring support for postfix dereferencing (<code>-&gt;*%</code> and <code>-&gt;*@</code>) to older versions of perl.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Babble::Plugin::State</dt>
<dd>

<p>Bring support for the <code>state</code> keyword to older versions of perl.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Babel::Plugin::SKT</dt>
<dd>

<p>Bring support for the <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> syntax from <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Syntax::Keyword::Try">Syntax::Keyword::Try</a> without the Syntax::Keyword::Try module. Especially useful for older versions of perl that don&#39;t support the pluggable syntax system that Syntax::Keyword::Try relies upon and it can&#39;t be installed on.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Babble::Plugin::SubstituteAndReturn</dt>
<dd>

<p>Bring support for substitution regular expressions returning the changes rather than altering their input (<code>s///r</code>) to older versions of perl.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Back-at-the-North-Pole">Back at the North Pole</h3>

<p>With Babble the elves were able to ship even more of their code to run on third party servers - even those that only supported the ancient perl 5.8. Sure, Babble was experimental, but since the elves were able to do the transformation on the systems they controlled and test the code before they shipped it they had every confidence that what they shipped would work come Christmas Eve.</p>
