=head2 Our task

We want to remove undesired parts of an audio file, such as
various info breaks during a radio play. In other words, we
want to extract relevant parts of an audio file, and stitch
them together into a new file. We'll see how this happens
through an audio network language we'll use perl to
generate.

=head2 Our hammer

We'll be accomplishing this with Audio::Nama, a multitrack
recording mixing and audio-processing application written in
perl, and L<Ecasound|https://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/>, a
general-purpose audio engine. We also need git, which Nama
uses to manage project state, provide for branching, undo,
etc. C<nama> is the executable program script and also man
page, so "man nama" for the docs, or use nama's internal
help.

Nama configures Ecasound for recording, mixing and a variety
of tasks via a audio network definition called a I<chain
setup> with syntax we will use Nama to generate.

Aside from housekeeping duties, Nama's main task is to
regenerate the chain setup (and re-configure the engine)
whenever the graph changes due to user input, such
as deactivating a track or changing an output--a bit
like how a spreadsheet recalculates as necessary.

The first run of C<nama> creates a C<$HOME/nama> directory for
project files and a configuration file C<$HOME/.namarc>.

Nama assumes a linux environment: that you'll be recording
or listening from the default ALSA soundcard device,
usually your computer's built-in soundcard. You can
change this setting in C<namarc>.

=head2 Create a new project, add a track and import an audio file

We'll create a new project called 'christmas'.

C<$ nama -c christmas>

We get a startup banner, then an empty track listing:

	 No. Name       Requested  Status  Source                Destination   Vol   Pan
	===============================================================================
	  1  Main                  MON     Main bus              CH 1/2        100    50
	  2  Mixdown               OFF     track Main            --             --    --

	nama christmas Mixdown >

In the prompt, 'christmas' is the project, 'Mixdown', the current track.

We create a separate track to accommodate our audio file,
then import the file.

	nama christmas Mixdown > add-track carol
	nama christmas carol > import ~/music/christmas-carol.mp3

	format: s16_le,2,12000
	importing /home/jroth/music/christmas-carol.mp3 as /home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/carol_1.wav, converting to s16_le,2,44100,i

	 No. Name       Requested  Status  Source                Destination   Vol   Pan
	===============================================================================
	  1  Main                  MON     Main bus              CH 1/2        100    50
	  2  Mixdown               OFF     track Main            --             --    --
	  3  carol                 PLAY    carol_1.wav           Main bus      100    50

We can now press SPACE to start/stop playback.

In the track listing above we see that track 'carol' with
source C<carol_1.wav> is set to PLAY. The output of 'carol'
feeds the 'Main' track via the 'Main' bus. The 'Main' track
serves as the master fader with output to the sound card.
Like 'carol', all new tracks start as members of the 'Main'
bus.

=for :html
<center><img src="thin2.png" alt="section divider" width="7%"></center>

=head2 Define our clips

We will use a specialized type of bus called a 'sequence' to
stitch together clips from our radio play. First we need
to mark the beginning and end of each clip we want to
keep.

We do that by listening to the track and using the
C<clip-here> command (bound to the F1 key) to mark clip
starts and ends.

After some trial and error, we have the correct marks.
In this example: four five-minute sections of content
separated by 40-second breaks.

	nama christmas carol > list-marks

	0 40.0 clip-start-0020
	1 340.0 clip-end-0021
	2 380.0 clip-start-0022
	3 680.0 clip-end-0023
	4 720.0 clip-start-0024
	5 1020.0 clip-end-0025
	6 1060.0 clip-start-0026
	*7 1360.0 clip-end-0027


=head2 The final gathering

We can now assemble our clips.

	nama christmas carol > gather

	 No. Name       Requested  Status  Source                Destination   Vol   Pan
	===============================================================================
	  1  Main                  MON     Main bus              CH 1/2        100    50
	  2  Mixdown               OFF     track Main            --             --    --
	  3  carol                 MON     carol sequence        Main bus      100    50

Note that the source for track 3 has changed from C<carol_1.wav> to
C<carol sequence>.

Having listened to the output and resolved any hiccups
(there were none!) we are ready to render it to an audio
file.

	nama christmas carol > mixdown
	Enabling mixdown to file

	 No. Name       Requested  Status  Source                Destination   Vol   Pan
	===============================================================================
	  1  Main                  MON     Main bus              Mixdown       100    50
	  2  Mixdown               REC v1  Main                  --             --    --
	  3  carol                 MON     carol sequence        Main bus      100    50

	Now at: 0:00
	Engine is ready.
	Press SPACE to start the mixdown.

	Engine is running
	Engine is finished at 16:27

	recorded: Mixdown_1.wav
	Setting mixdown playback mode.

	 No. Name       Requested  Status  Source                Destination   Vol   Pan
	===============================================================================
	  1  Main                  OFF     Main bus              --            100    50
	  2  Mixdown               PLAY    Mixdown_1.wav         --             --    --
	  3  carol            MON  OFF     carol sequence        --            100    50

The mixdown step also generates ogg and mp3 encodings with
oggenc and lame, respectively, if desired. These files
appear in the project directory:

C<~/nama/christmas/christmas_1.mp3>
C<~/nama/christmas/christmas_1.ogg>
C<~/nama/christmas/christmas_1.wav> is a symlink to C<~/nama/christmas/.wav/Mixdown_1.wav>

=head2 How the sausage is made

=head3 Chain setup graph

An Ecasound chain setup is made of signal-processing
I<chains>--edges in the processing graph--and I<loop
devices>, which are nodes capable of summing their inputs.

A chain represents a stream with one input and one output.

Here is a setup of one chain, omitting general options
related to buffer sizes, etc.

	# audio inputs

	-a:3 -f:s16_le,2,44100 -i:/home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/carol_1.wav

	# audio outputs

	-a:3 -o:alsa,default

There is one chain, with label C<3>. Its input is from a .wav
file, and its output goes to the default soundcard. There is
an C<-f> argument that describes the audio signal bit width,
channel count and sample frequency.

Chains can terminate at an audio file, a sound device or a
loop device. A loop device is a buffer stage that can sum
the signal from one or more chains. It supplies the sum to
another chain (or possibly multiple chains.) A loop device
with its sources and an output chain can represent a mixer
or bus.

Significantly for our task, a chain can represent an I<audio clip>,
part of an audio file that plays at a particular time.

	-a:5 -f:s16_le,2,44100 -i:playat,40,select,80,300,/home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/carol_1.wav

The 'select,80,300' object extracts 300 seconds of audio
starting at 0:80. The 'playat,40' option plays the audio
after a delay of 40 seconds.

Chains also perform effects processing.  They can host
plugins and plugin controllers called I<chain operators>
included in Ecasound and provided by numerous
L<LADSPA|https://ladspa.org> and
L<LV2|https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/categories/lv2_plugins>
authors.

=for :html
<center><img src="thin2.png" alt="section divider" width="7%"></center>

=head3 Basic mixer configuration

Each time a change in track status occurs, Nama generates a
Chain setup file and commands Ecasound to load it.

Let's start with the mixer configuration when we imported
our radio play.

	 No. Name       Requested  Status  Source                Destination   Vol   Pan
	===============================================================================
	  1  Main                  MON     Main bus              CH 1/2        100    50
	  2  Mixdown               OFF     track Main            --             --    --
	  3  carol                 PLAY    carol_1.wav           Main bus      100    50

This is the corresponding chain setup:

	nama christmas carol > chains

	# audio inputs

	-a:1 -f:s16_le,16,44100,i -i:loop,Main_in
	-a:3 -f:s16_le,2,44100 -i:/home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/carol_1.wav

	# audio outputs

	-a:1 -o:alsa,default
	-a:3 -f:s16_le,16,44100,i -o:loop,Main_in

Above we have two chains, labeled C<1>, and C<3>,
corresponding to our tracks 'Main' and 'carol'.

Chain C<3> reads C<carol_1.wav> and sends its output to loop
device C<Main_in>.  Chain C<1> read the stream from
C<Main_in> and supplies it to the soundcard.

=head3 Debug output

By starting Nama with the C<-L ChainSetup> logging option,
we can see the steps from Nama's representation of the
routing graph to the final chain setup. Initially, tracks
in the graph are allowed to connect directly. Then the graph
is simplified. Dead branches are removed. Finally, loop
devices are introduced between tracks. I only include the
graph where it changes.

	[1513] ChainSetup  (L 106) Graph after bus routing:
	wav_in-carol, carol-Main

	[1514] ChainSetup  (L 111) Graph after aux sends:
	[1514] ChainSetup  (L 114) Graph with paths from Main:
	wav_in-carol, carol-Main, Main-soundcard_out

	[1514] ChainSetup  (L 117) Graph with mixdown mods:
	[1514] ChainSetup  (L 216) Graph after simplify_send_routing:
	[1514] ChainSetup  (L 218) Graph after remove_out_of_bounds_tracks:
	[1514] ChainSetup  (L 220) Graph after recursively_remove_inputless_tracks:
	[1515] ChainSetup  (L 222) Graph after recursively_remove_outputless_tracks:
	[1515] ChainSetup  (L 122) Graph after pruning unterminated branches:
	[1515] ChainSetup  (L 126) Graph after adding loop devices:
	wav_in-carol, carol-Main_in, Main_in-Main, Main-soundcard_out

	[1515] ChainSetup  (L 130) Graph with inserts:

So this is our final graph:

	wav_in-carol, carol-Main_in, Main_in-Main, Main-soundcard_out

At this point, one end of each edge is a track. An
edge--associating one track and one terminal--is sufficient
to write an input or output line in the chain setup.

This happens through dispatch on the type of terminal, and
generates IO objects, each used to write one line of the
chain setup: a different class for each type of terminal.

	[1515] ChainSetup  (L 360) dispatch: wav_in -> carol
	[1515] ChainSetup  (L 362) name: carol, endpoint: wav_in, direction: input
	[1516] ChainSetup  (L 360) dispatch: Main -> soundcard_out
	[1516] ChainSetup  (L 362) name: Main, endpoint: soundcard_out, direction: output
	[1516] ChainSetup  (L 360) dispatch: carol -> Main_in
	[1516] ChainSetup  (L 362) name: carol, endpoint: Main_in, direction: output
	[1516] ChainSetup  (L 360) dispatch: Main_in -> Main
	[1516] ChainSetup  (L 362) name: Main, endpoint: Main_in, direction: input


	bless( {
	  chain_id_ => 3,
	  endpoint_ => "wav_in",
	  track_ => "carol",
	}, 'Audio::Nama::IO::from_wav' )

	bless( {
	  chain_id_ => 1,
	  endpoint_ => "soundcard_out",
	  track_ => "Main",
	}, 'Audio::Nama::IO::to_alsa_soundcard_device' )

	bless( {
	  chain_id_ => 3,
	  device_id_ => "loop,Main_in",
	  endpoint_ => "Main_in",
	  track_ => "carol",
	}, 'Audio::Nama::IO::to_loop' )

	bless( {
	  chain_id_ => 1,
	  device_id_ => "loop,Main_in",
	  endpoint_ => "Main_in",
	  track_ => "Main",
	}, 'Audio::Nama::IO::from_loop' )

These classes provide methods that can be overridden by
field values annotated on the graph edges or graph nodes,
with the edge (chain) values having the highest priority.

Overrides are used for mixdown and anywhere values for an IO
object need to differ from those derived from the parent
track.


=head3 Assembling our audio clips

We'll look at the project after we issued the C<gather>
command and entered <mixdown>, ready to render the sequenced
clips. The output of track 'Main' feeds track 'Mixdown'
which will write C<Mixdown_1.wav>.

	 No. Name       Requested  Status  Source                Destination   Vol   Pan
	================================================================================
	  1  Main                  MON     Main bus              Mixdown       100    50
	  2  Mixdown               REC v1  Main                  --             --    --
	  3  carol                 MON     carol sequence        Main bus      100    50

If we show hidden tracks, we see our four clips, each represented as a track.
The source for each is the same audio file.

	nama christmas carol > sha # show all tracks

	 No. Name       Requested  Status  Source                Destination   Vol   Pan
	===============================================================================
	  1  Main                  MON     Main bus              CH 1/2        100    50
	  2  Mixdown               OFF     track Main            --             --    --
	  3  carol                 MON     carol sequence        Main bus      100    50
	  4  carol-1-carol-v       PLAY    carol_1.wav           carol sequen  100    50
	  5  carol-2-carol-v       PLAY    carol_1.wav           carol sequen  100    50
	  6  carol-3-carol-v       PLAY    carol_1.wav           carol sequen  100    50
	  7  carol-4-carol-v       PLAY    carol_1.wav           carol sequen  100    50

In the chain setup below we see that C<select> and C<playat> terms
are used in the inputs to define a region of the audio file and play it
with a given delay. The values were generated from our list
of marks.

	# audio inputs

	-a:1 -f:s16_le,16,44100,i -i:loop,Main_in
	-a:3 -f:s16_le,16,44100,i -i:loop,carol_in
	-a:4 -f:s16_le,2,44100 -i:select,40,300,/home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/carol_1.wav
	-a:5 -f:s16_le,2,44100 -i:playat,300,select,380,300,/home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/carol_1.wav
	-a:6 -f:s16_le,2,44100 -i:playat,600,select,720,300,/home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/carol_1.wav
	-a:7 -f:s16_le,2,44100 -i:playat,900,select,1060,300,/home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/carol_1.wav
	-a:Mixdown -f:s16_le,16,44100,i -i:loop,Main_out

	# audio outputs

	-a:1 -f:s16_le,16,44100,i -o:loop,Main_out
	-a:3 -f:s16_le,16,44100,i -o:loop,Main_in
	-a:4,5,6,7 -f:s16_le,16,44100,i -o:loop,carol_in
	-a:Mixdown -f:s16_le,2,44100,i -o:/home/jroth/nama/christmas/.wav/Mixdown_1.wav

Some overriding was involved, as we see C<-a:Mixdown>, a
chain identifier that is not a track number. I think there
was some technical reason, but it does stand out.
