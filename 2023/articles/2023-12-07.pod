Title: HTML/XSS scrubbing and file upload validation in Catalyst
Topic: Catalyst::Plugin::CheckFileUploadTypes

=encoding utf8

At work, we needed to tighten up the security of our Catalyst-powered
API, with two main requirements:

=over

=item *

Stripping HTML/XSS attempts from incoming parameters

=item *

Validating that file uploads are expected and are the expected type

=back

=head2 Catalyst::Plugin::HTML::Scrubber

We found L<Catalyst::Plugin::HTML::Scrubber>, which at first glance looked
like it would do at least most of what we needed, automatically scrubbing
parameters using L<HTML::Scrubber>.

We're not a fan of reinventing wheels when we can avoid it, so I set about
adding the extra features we needed - in particular, being able to exempt
particular parameters from scrubbing, by name or regex match - and raised a pull
request to share that upstream.  Unfortunately, the original author doesn't seem
to be active in the Perl community any more, and several attempts of contact
failed - so I followed the usual steps to L<adopt a module|https://neilb.org/2013/07/24/adopt-a-module.html>,
approaching our friendly CPAN admins for help, obtained co-maint, and released 
a new version.

Since then we added more - including recursive scrubbing of parameters within 
serialised POSTed/PUTted request bodies.

=head2 Catalyst::Plugin::CheckFileUploadTypes

Next, we needed to add checking of uploaded files.  Some API actions do expect
uploaded files, but most don't.  We wanted to make it easy to centralise that
checking so that if an action hasn't specified that it expects file uploads,
any attempts to upload files in requests sent to it should be rejected.

It should also be easy for the action to denote which MIME types it expects
to receive, without lots of boilerplate code being added to each action.

Naturally you'd want to use something to determine the type of file you were
actually sent and can't just trust the C<Content-Type> header in the request,
because the client could lie to us.

We didn't find anything that fitted our needs, so I created
L<Catalyst::Plugin::CheckFileUploadTypes>, using subroutine attributes on the
actions to mark that they expect uploads, for instance:

=begin perl

    use Catalyst qw(CheckFileUploadTypes);
    
    # Actions can declare that they expect to receive file uploads:
    sub upload_file : Local ExpectUploads { ... }
    
    # They can also specify that any uploaded files must be of expected types
    # (determined from file content by File::MMagic, not what the client said,
    # as they could lie to us)
    sub upload_file : Local ExpectUploads(image/jpeg image/png) { ... }

=end perl

There was a little bit of fun involved if the app is using
L<Catalyst::Action::REST>, in which case we want to be looking for the
attributes on the C<_type>-suffixed action - for e.g. C<index_POST>.

More features are planned (and may well have been implemented by the time you
read this!) - including:

=over

=item Wildcards

for e.g. the ability to say e.g. C<image/*> for any type of image

=item Extra heuristics to distinguish more file types

For example, both a shell script and an XML file are both C<text/plain>
according to the underlying L<File::MMagic>; that's not very helpful.

=item More options

More options to provide more control over how unexpected uploads are handled

=item Callbacks

Callbacks to fire for each uploaded file to perform additional checks on it - 
for example, running it through a virus checker, generating a hash and checking
online services for matches, or other checks on the content of the file.
