In the imortal words of Judy Galand:

<i>
<p>
Have yourself a merry little Christmas<br>
Let your heart be light<br>
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight
</p>
<p>
Have yourself a merry little Christmas<br>
Make the yuletide gay<br>
Next year all our troubles will be miles away
</p>
<p>
Once again as in olden days<br>
Happy golden days of yore<br>
Faithful friends who were near to us<br>
Will be dear to us once more
</p>
<p>
Someday soon we all will be together<br>
If the fates allow<br>
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow<br>
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
</p>

There's been so much awesomeness in the Perl community over the past year that
I'd like to thank each and every one involved for making the best of things.
For example, I really enjoyed L<Conference In The Cloud|https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/>.
Despite not being able to see my friends and members of the community in person,
I got to speak at a conference without the usual hassle of flying and being
away from my family.

Thank you one and all.

So until next year, or I<Someday soon when we will all be together> I wish you
the very happiest of Christmas.
