2020 has been time consuming - a global pandemic, giant fires, horrific floods
and political unrest - which has left us little time for side projects.
This year we're looking back to happier times into the 20+ year archive with the
Best of the Perl Advent Calendar.

Every day we have to tell our computers about the hundreds of choices we make
each day.  Yes, I'd like to get the blue scarf, not the green one.  Change into
this directory not that one.  Please force push those changes all over that
branch.  Yes, of course I'm sure!

Being the command line geeks we are, most of the time this comes in the form of
passing arguments to command line programs.  Passing option flags.  Setting
environment variables before we run the script.  All of these things are awesome.
We can script them.  There's command history.  We can use command line tab
completion (if we've setup bash or zsh just right.)

But sometimes this can get complex.  Maybe as users we don't (or can't) know
what all the options are without starting to run the script.  Maybe we need to
be presented with more choices depending on some of the choices we've already
made.  Maybe the program needs to ask the user something after it's done
something with a remote server, and there was no way to predict what questions
it needed to have the answer for when the program was originally run.  Or maybe
we just want something more user friendly than forcing the user to look up in
the man page what options they need to pass.

In these situations we tend to build an interactive GUI app or a web app.
However, both of these are much harder to do than writing a program that parses
simple command line options - there's event loops to consider, callbacks,
possibly listening on various ports.  Maybe there's a better, er, I<choice>.

=head2 Introduction Term::Choose

L<Term::Choose> is a module that allows us to interactively pick from the
terminal from several options.  It's I<really> simple to use:

    #!perl
    use Term::Choose qw( choose );
    my $reindeer = choose([qw(
        Ruldolph
        Dasher Dancer Prancer Vixen
        Comet Cupid Dunder Blixem
    )], { prompt => 'Who is your favourite reindeer?' }) or exit;
    say "Cool I like $reindeer too!";

=for :html
  <img src="chooser.gif" width="678" height="177" alt="Terminal demo">

The user simply moves the selection around with the cursor keys and hits
C<RETURN> to pick one.  Easy!

Coding this is considerably more simple than developing a GUI or web app, and
because it's running on a terminal you can make use of it anywhere - even on
a remote server you're connected to over ssh without the overhead and the
complexity of doing something tricky with an X-server.

Note also that Term::Choose is a good terminal citizen.  It cleans up after
itself, removing the interactive prompt from the screen.

=head2 More options than fit on the screen

If you have more options than fit on the screen then the screen scrolls when
you move down past the last option:

    #!perl
    use Term::Choose qw( choose );
    my $film = choose(
       \@films,
       { prompt => 'What Christmas movie shall I rent?' },
    ) or exit;
    say "Renting $film";

=for :html
  <img src="choosef.gif" width="678" height="177" alt="Terminal demo">

Neat!  You really don't have to think about it.

=head2 Picking More Than One Option

If you use the C<choose> function in list context you can pick more than
one option.  Just hitting C<RETURN> works as before, picking just the one
option.  However, hitting C<SPACE> selects multiple options, and then C<RETURN>
submits them all.

    #!perl
    use Term::Choose qw( choose );
    my @options = choose([
        'with wrapping paper',
        'with a bow on it',
        'with ribbons',
        'with a gift tag',
    ], { prompt => 'How should I wrap up the present?' });
    say "Wrapping up the present with $_" for @options;

=head2 The Right Choice

Like all my favourite Perl modules, Term::Choose is powerful but simple to
use.  It does one thing, and does it well.  It's the right choice.
