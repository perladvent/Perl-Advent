Title: Perl Weekly
Topic: Perl Weekly

Every year for the last twenty one years we at the Perl Advent Calendar have
been telling you about twenty four modules, code, or tools that we love. And
every year, on Christmas day, I typically throw in a few links to other Perl
resources on the web, somewhat as an afterthought.

But it's not the code, or these tools, or the language features that make an
awesome programming langugage - it's the members of the programming community
that produce that code, those tools, and the language features - not to mention
offer you the support, let you know about what's going on, and teach you about
these new things.  I stand on the shoulders of giants, and, yes, believe it or
not, I'm saying the real treasure is the friends you make along the way...

So this year I'm going to flip the script - I'm going to spend twenty four days
linking to places on the internet where the various Perl communities have been
awesome.  For you following along at home, this does indeed mean that this year
Santa is giving you homework.

So, what's new in the world of Perl?  These days I find out all the latest once
a week from the fabulous L<Perl Weekly|https://perlweekly.com/> newsletter.

A long time ago Perl had a dedicated news website that updated several times a
day called "use.perl.org".  It was a slash site (back when "slash site" meant
running the open source Perl code that also ran Slashdot.org, not a tumblr blog
shipping Klance) which I dearly loved, but the Perl Weekly newsletter is better.

While it may seem like getting updates several times a day would be superior -
didn't we move away from email to the web for ease of use? - it's not.  It's
much better to have someone curate this firehose of information to just the
interesting things.  Think of it more like reading
L<NextDraft|https://nextdraft.com/> rather than the entire of Twitter.  There's
a reason why small newsletters are back in fashion.

The Perl Weekly newsletter shows up in my inbox every Monday morning like
clockwork.  Preferring in general to link to content rather than include it
outright, it's assembled by some of my favorite Perl people, and is written
with a friendly tone to inform rather than as a marketing exercise.

And if email isn't your cup of tea?  You can always read it on the web,
subscribe via RSS, or any number of other social networks.  Give it a shot for
a couple of weeks - I'll guarantee you'll enjoy it.
