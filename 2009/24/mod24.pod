One minor nit with it though, is that punctuation is forbidden between
the C<get> and C<set> blocks, which means that code formatters can be confused
(as perltidy was below) and the second block's contents will likely be
over-indented in your editor contents will be over-indented in your editor.
Fortunately, you can specify your blocks in whichever order you prefer,
so if one is much shorter than the other you can list it second to reduce
the visual impact of misindenting.
